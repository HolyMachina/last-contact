# The Three

## December 1, 2274 CE

### Terra Firma

#### New York City

##### Impulse Tower

Chancellor Fulton sat at his solid carved onyx desk looking at a report. Three generals and a scientist stood on the other side of the desk. "This is the biggest threat the Terra Firma Empire has faced in decades. Thank you for doing this research Dr. Palnov." He looked at his generals. "The contents of the report and the risk it poses we are lucky in a couple of ways, one of them is already in custody. Get the other two. Make sure they *never* find their way back to pose a threat to the Empire."

## December 15, 2274 CE

### Terra Firma

#### Tokyo Japan

##### Saik≈ç-Saibansho Building

A tall Japanese man stood before a jury of his peers. The judge was looking down upon him from a raised desk. This man was not on trial. He stood for the government of Terra Firma and he knows he is right. "Mr. Li. You and your family have been practicing witchcraft in violation of the Charter of both the Terra Firma Government and the United Christian Church of the Terra Firma. This is punishable by death, or lifetime mental and memory imprisonment and separation from civil society so you are no longer corrupting it. Which do you deserve? Death; but that is not my decision to make I defer that to the wise members of the jury." He made a grand bow to the jury fully expecting them to be on his side. The law is clear in this matter, he won. He then slowly walked back to his desk and sat alone with a smirk.

Everyone looked toward the other desk. At this desk sat a young family and their lawyer. The man, and a badly injured woman sat solemnly. They both looked toward the other man at the table. Their eyes spoke not of regret but distaste of a society that would imprison them for practicing a religion different than the official one. Their son, nine-years old, looked around at the large room with eyes of wonder. They had spent the last four months in a six by six-foot concrete room without hardly ever leaving. At least they spent their time together, as a family.

The judge looked down toward them and continued the process, "Counselor, your closing argument."

The older man stood up from beside the family and looked at them pitifully. He then turned to the jury and started walking toward them as he was speaking. "We all know what was found in the home of the Li family. Those are facts. What we are debating is if he used those items. This is truly a case of a collector of ancient antiquities, Jin Li, who collected items from times past. He had a great interest in eras and religion past. At the time he was collecting them it was not illegal to collect such things. These items were never used."

He paused. The timber of his voice went much louder as if to impress the point, "No witchcraft was ever practiced by any member of this family." He changed to speak in a quieter, almost fatherly, tone. "Jin has learned his lesson. The police have destroyed the items as the new law states. Jin and his family have served four months in prison. Why would you punish his wife, Kikue, and his son, Timothy, for an error Jin made? Isn't that an injustice on its own? That injustice has already been done." The public defender looked sympathetically back toward the young family. Then he turned back to the jury.

The lawyer walked back to the table and then sat down next to his clients. He said something just loud enough that only the family could hear. Jin and Kikue scowled at him.

Timothy Li would remember this moment as the first time he ever felt betrayed. The death of his mother would be the second, due to the injuries she had. That would come in a couple of days.

## February 10, 2276 CE

### En-route from Pluto to Venus

#### HMS Arcadian

##### King's Stateroom

The room was dark. There was the sound of snoring in the cabin. The room lit up in bright red as an alarm tore through the air. The snoring man awoke with a start. For the interior of a spaceship it was a very nice cabin. The bed he was sleeping in was king-sized and very comfortable. Very apt given the fact he was a king. The intercom jumped to life. "Your Majesty, we have come under attack by what appears to be Terra Firma special forces. I suggest you come to the bridge."

"Yes Captain, I will be right there." He quickly threw on a dressing gown which looked more formal than the suits of many of his crew. He exited his stateroom, turned the corner, and entered the bridge.

##### Bridge

The Captain saw him enter and quickly gave him a briefing. "They have us surrounded. The weapons they are firing are designed to disable our ship. King Romulus, they have demanded our surrender and that we allow them to board at once."

"Have they given us reason for this illegal search and boarding of a royal vessel?"

"No, sir."

King Romulus walked a couple of steps to a command console that was unoccupied. It was the largest console on the bridge and there was a large green button which he pressed and began to speak. "Hailing all Terra Firma military vessels, this is King Romulus of the Government of Venus. Our governments have disagreed about things in the past but now enjoy a tenuous state of peace. Your attack on this vessel, if continued, will constitute as an act of war and we will retaliate. Any boarding of this vessel, even if we allow your boarding, will also constitute as the same. Cease your attack at once." King Romulus let go of the button and the line clicked to static.

A couple of moments later the line clicked open again. "We refuse. Please submit to boarding or we will continue to fire to disable your vessel."

"Captain open the next communication both to them and the Venusian Senate." The captain clicked a couple of switches on his console. He nodded back toward King Romulus. The king pressed the green button again. "This is your final warning. We will allow your boarding, there is no need to continue attacking us. However, the Venusian Senate will interpret this as an act of war. They are also receiving this broadcast. Expect retaliation and a formal declaration of war if you persist on boarding us."

"We will continue to board your craft, please submit for boarding." The response was sharp and unforgiving. The King nodded to his captain and the captain responded in kind. "Power down all weapons, come to full stop, prepare the docking collars and light up the exterior hull."

The king clicked another button on his console and opened an in-ship intercom. "Dear, I need you to wake up. The Terra Firma Government has decided to stop and board us. Please get up and put on a dressing gown."

She turned over and responded, "What did you say dad?"

The voice crackled slightly over the intercom. "I need you to get up, and at least put on a dressing gown. We're being boarded."

"Boarded?"

"Yep, I'm sending two security guards to hang out with you."

"Send Lilija and Sebastian."

"Okay dear."

The king nodded to the captain and head of security. The head of security, a large man, left the room quickly. The captain was the first to speak "What do you think they want? They sure won't tell us."

"I have no idea what they want, but they got a war‚Ä¶"

As the Terra Firma military vessel docked with the civilian royal cruiser, Terra Firma Military began fanning out across the vessel. Ten minutes after that they had left the ship and were beginning to move away. The king spoke to the captain, "They had a mission and clearly completed it. It's odd that they didn't come to the bridge."

As the Terra Firma military craft departed the captain opened the PA. "Status check all departments. In the center of the bridge a panel came down from the ceiling with each department of the spacecraft pictured. Each department turned from clear to green, except for one. A couple of minutes later the only thing left in clear was "Royal Staterooms." The captain turned to the King. "Nobody responding from the staterooms?"

The king looked over to the head of security and he nodded to his top two men they quickly left the bridge. A couple of moments later the area turned red and over the intercom came a detailed report. "Your Majesty, the two guards assigned to your daughter are dead, and she has been abducted."

## June 19, 2278 CE

### Terra Firma

#### Helsinki, Finland

##### Eiran Sairaala Hospital

It was worth it. Sam's mom had brought them halfway across the world to get this done.

He was just waking up from surgery. His surgeon was standing over him and smiling. "It went very well." He smiled weakly toward the doctor. He was in a great deal of pain, but he was reborn. Now his body matched what he knew; he was a boy.

His mother sat by his side holding his hand. "Congratulations, Samuel."

"I'm finally me," Sam whispered back.

Suddenly three men in suits barged into the hospital room. They moved quickly. The first one moved to behind the doctor and forced him to drop the things he was holding handcuffing him behind his back. Before Sam's mother knew it the second moved to her pushing her up and away from the hospital bed. Handcuffs tightened around her writs. The third officer attached her son to his hospital bed.

"You are all under arrest under authority of the Government of Terra Firma for participating in illegal surgery to mutilate the human body as defined by God."
