# Writing a Big Story

February 8, 2025

## What could have been

I was trying to keep up on writing and had a good couple weeks of writing I even created a stock of "ready to go chapters" but as you can see there came a time when I ran out of writing energy, posting what I had stocked up then stepping away. My goal was to post every friday. And I want to get back to that. That means writing. I dug out of storage today the books that really inspired me to write and take this 'what if' that's in my head and make it into a sci-fi political thriller.

## Where'd it start?

### (Before 1994)

I was a kid. Everything "seemed" normal. But I didn't quite fit in. I couldn't figure out why, but at one point I asked my grandma "Do you know anyone who's gender was broken?"

### (1994 - 2003)

When I was eight or nine I started to have very vibrant dreams. The first one of which was very confusing to me, it felt very much like an out of body experience. They were the kind of dreams that leave you *remembering* them as you wake up. It didn't really create sleep disturbances. I felt fine and rested when I woke up. One of those dreams contained an idea that formed the premise of one of the key revelations of the book. I started having dreams that focused on that concept and how life had to exist if that fact were true. I connected more to my dream world than the real world around me. It felt like I didn't belong in the real world. I just existed. It felt like I belonged within the very vibrant dreams I was having. Around the same time a three to four year time in my life happened I started experiencing trauma. Until this point in my life I hadn't really had to face things like death, and relationships ending, and puberty. As a transgender person, one of the most traumatic things I've been though is... well... puberty. As puberty took hold for real two things seemed to happen at once, I started lying about who I was, and the dreams stopped. But then, junior high ended and high school started.

## The written path

### (2003 - 2006)

I have a very strange relationship with the written word. From the beginning of my life though till about my twenties I hated reading. I really did. I didn't understand why people were always trying to get me to read but reading didn't connect with me. I had to focus so hard on understanding each word instead of focusing on the picture they created together and at this point I didn't understand why. I loved content that provided me content that was fully formed in pictures and had dialog, tv shows, comic books, movies, etc. The feeling adults at the time gave me was as if the media that effectively transmitted the story to me was somehow inferior. When the visual content *also* had to be transmitted with words I could not focus on both.

I struggled my way though high school reading assignments, making up answers as I went along as if I had written it. It worked to an extent. I graduated high school (just barely) and went to college because that was the expectation of me. There was a path laid out before me. High School, to College, to a career, and marriage, and kids with a white picket fence. You know. *The Path,* the assumptions of the american dream is what was laid out before me. I was privileged enough to be on the path without having to do much *work.* I tried so hard to fit in. Boy Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, Playing Guitar, I did a lot of things. Nothing felt 'me.'

I followed expectations as best I could but the core of the universe that the dreams put in my mind, never left me. It constantly nagged at my life. Those dreams from all those years ago. I outlined the key points to the universe in my head in a notebook and threw it aside. That was enough to get it out of my brain. I moved back home and started living with my mom while still trying to get college done. Then... it became impossible to find a job.

## Growth

### (2007 - 2011)

This time of my life showed a huge amount of personal growth and development even though it probably didn't seem like it from the outside.

So, I was living a life with just me and my mom in the house. I largely had the house to myself as I looked for a job. It got demoralizing very fast. At first looking for a job was a full time job but I was trying to be a little picky and find a job I would *enjoy*. Then the financial crisis happened in 2008 and I had to stop being picky. I didn't see the crisis coming or I would have stopped being picky earlier. Then came multiple years of sending out resumes and applications and getting zero response. You can only throw yourself into a void so many times before you can't take it anymore. Depression was getting to me and I started writing. It was about this time when there stopped being *pressure* to read and I picked up a book on my own for the first time. At the time I was enamored with greek myth, and I picked up the Iliad and the Odyssey. The lack of pressure to read changed how I saw books. I started reading them for *fun* I still didn't quite get all the visual pictures but I could slow down and really understand more of the *intentions.* Understanding the story, even without understanding the visuals changed my life. Reading was still a lot of work, but at least now I was getting value out of it. I went back to a lot of the books I read in school. Once I could slow down and not focus on passing a quiz every week my eyes were opened.

I also had lots of free time on my hands, so I started reaching out to religion. I started reaching out to politics. I picked up history. I picked up economics. All the things I should have learned in school but couldn't for one reason or another I revisited. Up until this point these things were only in my life at a surface level they were requirements to keep on my *path* and not let anyone down. However, now I had given up on the path. I had to make my own. I wanted to understand and actually make decisions for myself. That meant being informed about the people and things around me? I approached each on *my* terms. I studied everything I could at the level of depth *I wanted,* which if you know me you know... When I get into something, I get pretty deep... But I don't stay on any one topic for long. Every religion I could find, every economic and political system I could find. Every historical decade. To everyone around it me I'm sure it looked like I was doing nothing; just playing on my computer. But the internet was had arrived. Tech companies opened my world. My world had opened and, believe it or not, at that time on the internet you could find *actual information.*

During this time, *that I had plenty of,* I started writing the original version of Last Contact. I would take everything I learned about history, religion, politics, economics, science, and roll them into this universe. It expanded exponentially as plots and characters were created in my head. I found a sci-fi series that I fell in love with called [The Saga of the Seven Suns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Seven_Suns). This sci-fi series changed my life. The way it was written followed a massive amount of characters but the very short chapters moved from character to character so you could express an entire universe instead of following a couple of specific characters. In 2008, I wrote an initial timeline that was my projection of a simulation that stretched from 2004 through to the initial beginning of the first book (2259). That formed the baseline of everything I wrote after that. As events happened I compared them to my timeline. The accuracy level of that original timeline still terrifies me. Maybe I'll put the unedited original timeline on the website at some point. I tried a lot of different ways of getting what would become Last Contact out of my head. Nothing worked, I couldn't express it right.

During this time I spent a lot of time with my step sister. She pushed me take in everything around me and form it into my own beliefs of the world; not to be a follower. So, I tried. It all got put into the first version of last contact. It was terrible writing, but it was about 100 thousand words of everything around me.

Before I could finish it, I lost her. One of her last acts was to call out all my shells and told me I was supposed to be a girl the whole time. That started a downward spiral that I didn't see an end to. It wouldn't have ended but then a friend of mine said "hey, you want a job?"

## Work

### (2011 - 2014)

My first *almost* full time job (they gave us just the right amount of hours to not be considered full time *37.5*) was in a call center. I did recruiting by phone for a company that did first line filtering for other companies. My job was to filter candidates, do a first interview over the phone, then schedule them for an in person second interview. I started to learn very quickly how *work* worked and I hated it. On the days I worked I could to nothing else, it was a two to three hour commute on the bus (or train) and I'm an introvert so talking to people all day was extremely tough. I tried to get up as late as possible so I took a lot of evening shifts that ended at midnight. Writing took a back seat. I moved out of my mom's house. I moved in with room mates and a partner. Then I had a friend who got me a job as an IT person in high school district. Near the end of this time I started struggling pretty bad with discontent around my life and the shell I had put up around me. I started writing a lot about my feelings and gender separate from what would become Last Contact. I had to take leave and enter pretty intensive therapy.

## Hormones come home to roost

### (2015 - 2019)

Well, transitioning was weird. Four years of second puberty. I found a new job as a small cog in a large tech company. I made some bad choices, made some good choices. Struggled my way though life with too little money. Yet clawing at the inside of my head the entire time was the universe that would become Last Contact. I tried many different ways to write, phone, laptop, pen and paper, *typewriter,* random pieces went random directions. I saved little stories all over the place. However, work was my life. I did a lot of overtime. Then I got a huge promotion and became a boss. At that point work really took over my life, I felt compelled to be on call 24/7. It was sleep or work. I got another promotion that would take my to headquarters and make me an individual contributor again making policy for 2,000 people like myself. In the fall of 2019, I moved to Seattle.

## Live on Habits

### (2019 - Nov. 2024)

For those of you that don't know me I survive on habits. Once something is a pattern it will stick till the habit is broken. Well, in the fall of 2019 I moved to Seattle Metro area. This really everything that had been my life for the last 5 years. I was in tge middle of making new habits, including writing, when COVID happened. That caused everything to break again and new habits to build around what was already stable. These habits, my partner, and our dog, are what got me through COVID. I lived on work, I lived on routine. Every once in a while my partner would add a spark of "let's do xyz..." but for the most part life was work. It didn't help that work was very busy at the major tech company I work at and I took on more and more because I wanted to make life better for the people who experienced the impact of my work. I got sucked in. Again what little time I had totally free was spent watching something or otherwise trying to recoup energy. I couldn't make writing a habit. We moved back to Chicago-land. Work was still the majority of my life. Until the fall of 2024, when I finally said enough and changed roles to something a little smaller. All of a sudden I had time...

## Holy Fuck

### (Nov. 2024 - Present)

Well, that happened. Again. And the timeline stayed about 85% accurate. I decided it was now or never so I found and dug up all the writings I had written over the years for Last Contact and put them all into one place on my computer. I built a website and started editing, publishing, and writing. I did really good for while to write every single day. I made it a habit. Well, I got physically sick after a trip to Seattle. The habit fell apart and I used up all my stored "ready for publishing" writing. I fell out of the habit, so it stopped happening. I also picked up one of the most personally addictive video games again... EVE-Online.

Not to mention I had a lot of changes happening -- I started therapy again. I'm on some new medications to help manage my depression. I'm trying to take care of myself with hair cuts and other thing like that that totally fell by the wayside.

As for writing... I need to get back to it... So I still have a lot of drafts.. Time to get back to work.
