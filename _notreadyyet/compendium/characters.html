- [Brief Character Descriptions](#brief-character-descriptions) has a description of each major character, their physical description and some key traits involved with their character and their state as of January 1, 2285 (the start of the core story)
- [Character Location Timeline](#character-location-timeline) is a set of charts that shows which orbital body each character is at or near during different parts of the story.
