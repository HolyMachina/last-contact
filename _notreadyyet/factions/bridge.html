# Bridge

## December 3, 2280 CE

### Mars, Dorsa Argentea

#### Planum Citadel

Looking down with his deep blue eyes, Jamie Hedlund could see the domed cities of Schmidt, Fontana, Von Karman and Phillips built into the craters pockmarking the south western hemisphere of Mars. He was the heir to the throne, the only Prince of Mars. Yet, his role was that of a mouth piece, and his planet was always at war. He looked up and saw the usual combat formation of ships, battling over the horizon near the equator. Somehow it was a constant stalemate between the ships of Venus and the ships of Terra Firma. The southern half of Mars was one of the largest colonies of Terra Firma and the northern half was one of the largest colonies of Venus. It was too bad he didn't understand why they had to fight. He had watched fourteen years of this pointless struggle, he had watched it since the day he was born.

##### Prince's Quarters

Prince Hedlund turned away from the window and opened the elaborate door to his chambers to find an unmarked white envelope sitting on his bedside table. His attention was pulled to the curtain around the window which fluttered slightly despite lack of wind. His father told him it was coming, he still didn't want to believe. In a era where holographic video virtual chats and recorded messages were the normal, physical letters were extremely rare. He stared at it, unable to take his eyes off of it as he walked to his bed. The young prince picked up the letter he heard a rustling on the other side of the room. He spun around, looked up and saw the curtains move again by the open window. It was not a long distance to cover, but Jamie didn't do it fast enough. By the time he got there, the person with dark purple hair was already well out of reach sliding down the side of the icy castle. Twisting around, the prince of Mars made sure he was alone.

The envelope, still in his hand, was sealed and pristine. It appeared to have no openings at all. He had never seen an envelope that was air tight before. Using his index finger and thumb, he flicked it. There was a small hiss as martian air seeped into the corner of the envelope. It sprung back into position quickly, a large black marking appeared where he made contact with the envelope. The marking spread and turned red moving across the front of the envelope. The wording that appeared showed "TAMPERED". He was astounded about the amount of security that was involved in this situation. He walked back over to his bed and sat down. He opened the envelope and noticed the edges of it were starting to fray. A single page of paper greeted Jamie from the inside, he unfolded it and started reading.

> "Prince Hedlund,  
I am a friend of your father's. We have worked together on many occasions. The reason I am reaching out to you goes beyond you, or me. I am worried for the future of our species. Humans, we are all humans after all, are not that different from each other. There is a nature in Humanity, it seems to hate one another for reasons that are of our own creation. While our differences are skin deep, our similarities go to our very core. You have been watching the news, you have begun to understand the world around you. This is why I choose this moment to reach out to you. Believe it or not, you have the power to change the hearts and minds of your people, and mine."

Jamie stared at the letter. To think someone from Venus, presumably in a position of power, was reaching out to him. Why? The edges of the paper were beginning to fray. Jamie looked down at the fraying envelope and it was quickly rotting into the Martian air. He instinctively knew he had to finish it before it was gone.

> "I am sorry I am long-winded. Long story short, I work for the government of Venus. My sole goal is to open a path of communication between you, and us. If you ever have questions or concerns regarding anything, or if you every just want to talk to someone with a different opinion, I am here. My courier has delivered not only this letter to you but has also delivered a book. The book has been placed on the top shelf of your bookshelf, on the very left.  
When this letter is exposed to the Martian air, it will begin to decay and, at that point, it will only last about an hour. This is a security mechanism designed to keep this information secure. If and when you wish to contact me, use the book.

Jamie looked up to his bookshelf and a old looking leather bound brown book sat on his shelf. He didn't recognize it. He went over to take it off the shelf but was interrupted by the large gilded doors to his room sliding open. The Queen of Mars, and his father, who was not the King, walked in. Turning, his messy brown hair shuffled slightly. His parents, both also had blue eyes and both looked concerned. "Mom, Dad, what's going on?"  

"It comes from a friend of mine." He was clearly referencing the book his fourteen year old son just received. The only reason Jamie's dad wasn't a king was because he wasn't allowed to be. The queen's husband, and the prince's father, wasn't a citizen of Mars or a citizen of Terra Firma. He was a citizen of Venus, but particularly of the Venus' colony on Pluto. "Suffice to say, if anyone found out where it came from, we would be in trouble. It is now your most closely guarded secret." The only reason Jamie's father was still alive was because his mom promised indefinite allegiance to the Chancellor of Terra Firma in exchange for the life of the man she loved.

His mom spoke next. "We considered withholding this gift, it is, after all, just a blank book." Jamie took it off the shelf and opened the brown book to confirm that it was indeed blank. There weren't any markings on the cover or spine either. A confused expression crossed Jamie's face as he looked back to his mom, the queen. "I didn't ask for a new secret." His mother continued, "After discussing it a bit. We are hoping you will finally be the bridge between our two cultures."

"I doubt it." Jamie pointed out the window at the southern pole of Mars where a Terra Firma space craft hung in the air. "How would I get them to stop fighting if neither group takes their orders from me?"

"That's the question I've struggled with since I became Queen. There is no good answer to that one." She turned to leave. "I'm not sure what purpose that book will serve, but knowing the person it's from, it may eventually have that answer."

Jamie looked at the book, opening it again and flipping though it slowly. All the pages were still blank, how could it make a difference like that? "What do you mean by that?" He looked up to see that his mother and father had already left and closed the door behind them.

He went to his desk with the book and studied it some more. Flipping though each page they were indeed all blank. The pages felt different, it was almost as if they had a plastic layer around them, a lamination. However, none existed. This wasn't normal paper. Jamie didn't think he was capable of saving the world or changing minds, yet this person from Venus seemed to think so. He wondered if he was being used. This was too good to be true. Someone had a lot of faith in him, all of a sudden he felt small on the large scheme of the universe. He looked back at the book; it was so new. It looked old and unremarkable. He opened it, it appeared to contain only twenty five pages yet is was the size of a small novel. They were all blank. He sat down in his plush reading chair perplexing at this mysterious, apparently blank, old, brown, unremarkable book. He stared into the blank pages and concentrated. He didn't understand how a message could be sent though this useless thing.

It quickly warmed up. The more he concentrated, the warmer it became. When it became too hot to touch, he had to throw it to the ground. "This stupid book, it's clearly a trick." When he looked down, the brown leather of the book had turned black. He left it on the ground but couldn't look away. Testing it by touch, the book now felt normal. He hesitated then picked it up and opened it again.

"Once you close this book it will reset, all the words will be erased." There was a great deal more written but he closed the book out of shock. The book instantly felt freezing cold and turned brown again. "Shoot." He already knew but he opened it up to confirm. The rest of what was written was lost. He felt frustrated with himself and put the brown book back on the shelf.

## December 5, 2280 CE

### Mars, Dorsa Argentea

#### Planum Castle

##### Prince's Quarters

Jamie awoke as the light filtered onto his face though the blue tinted windows. Sitting up, his side table had been already populated with his usual breakfast of fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, and plant based sausages. He grumbled slightly. Raising animals on Mars proved to be exceptionally ineffective. Looking around his room, it had been mostly how he had left it last night. A maid had come in overnight and picked up a little, they left the false wall leading into the staff hallways open slightly. He got up and walked over to close the wall next to his bookshelf. The spine was black.

He took the book off the shelf and opened it up. He looked inside and the first page had writing on it "Hi. Please write in me." He closed the book it became cold and the leather turned brown again.

He sat down at his desk with a orange colored pen in hand and opened the book to stare down at the pages. They had no further insight to share.

Jamie wrote, "Who are you?" The words shimmered for a moment on the page then vanished.

"I am a friend of your father. This book will help us communicate across the vast physical distances between us. Just write in it and my spine will change color. Likewise the other direction."

"Where are you?"

One word appeared. "Pluto." In disbelief, it vanished before his eyes after he read it. Although, it took much longer for him to process the meaning.

Jamie's writing got sloppier as he wrote quickly "How can you really be there? No communication can go that fast. Who are you really? How are you doing this? What's your goal? Funny prank. I'll get my dad back later."

"No prank."

"How?"

"Magic... isn't just fairy tales."

"Why should I believe you?"

"Because your father put himself at great risk to get us this opportunity to talk."

"I'm done."

Just before he closed the book he saw the last message he would get for a while from this book. "It was nice to meet you."
