# The Wall

## September 20, 2284 CE

### Tethys, Ithaca Chasma

#### Terra Firma Dissident Prison Complex

##### Sam & Tim's Dorm Room

Sam went back to his room. He knew the three of them hatched a plan that would take place tonight. The room was 10 feet long by 15 feet wide. It had a small window on the short wall, and the door on the other short wall. Along one long wall, there were both a bunk-bed and a small desk. He sat on his bed and looked out the window at the grass he would be trying to run across soon to reach the field.

A couple of hours later, it was past lights out and Gwen had made her way undetected to the little room to join the two of them. They were on the second floor but that did not deter any of them from knowing what they had to do. Tim opened the window, looked down and muttered something under his breath. Then, he grabbed his backpack and jumped. Sam looked out the window to find his friend standing just fine, waiving at him to jump down. One deep breath later, it felt like he was floating, the air itself seemed to be supporting him to a soft landing. He landed without injury.

### Saturn Orbit

#### Watcher Ship Icarus

Mahtan Allorien could feel it though the metal dome. They felt it over the hundreds of thousands of kilometers the wave traveled. They felt it though the walls of his spaceship. Allorien did not need their computer to feel it. It was conscious magic. It was magic done by choice. The species of humans Allorien watched has done a lot of work to ignore the word and manifestation of energy called magic.

Humanity tried to explain away with science anything that could not be known. To unravel the mysteries of the energy around them. Humans choose not to ask the real questions that would help them grow as a people. They knew once, but seemed to forget, that they could control forces of energy stronger than anything they created. They called it "magic" because they could not explain it. However, with the advances they made in science, their advancement stalled. They could not progress any further using the scientific method. They only had one way left to advance, toward magic.

Allorien had been watching humanity since the year 2063. The earlier Mahtan, Pernelis, had died in 2096. The Crysix species deployed the Mahtan class of people to watch other species they had seeded around the galaxy. The Crysix measured Humanity's eras as each Mahtan's time. Mahtan Pernelis' era, which ranged from 1564 to 2096, was termed by the Crysix as "The downfall of Humanity." Humans called it many things but it all started with what humans called "The age of reason."

Allorien was here to see. There were many times where they thought Humanity would not continue to exist. Over the time Allorien had watched Humanity, they had written reports that had included lines such as "I don't expect them to survive the next fifty years." and "This species is our greatest success." Allorien's supervisors had chided him after the conflicting messages he sent. They claimed Allorien's reports were impulsive and irrational. This was one of the largest insults imaginable for the Crysix species. In fact, his reporting was logical. The species of Humanity was impulsive and irrational.

Allorien was roughly humanoid in shape and eight feet tall. His skin was extremely pale, sheet white and they wore long robes of the same color. His long silver hair and deep silver eyes supported a fully monochromatic appearance, the only thing that contracted his unified appearance was a blue ring floating unsupported above his head.

His space craft was invisible from the outside. Tiny cameras built into each side of the ship made the other side of the ship appear as if the ship was not there. Allorien's ship had an armor plating that Humanity could not detect with radar or any other means to their disposal yet.

Last time a child species detected a Crysix ship through a radar, it had caused a brief advance in Crysix technology. A species always created radar technology before they would contact the Crysix. Once the Crysix learned that, they began to develop a stealth technology that they had hoped would last until magic was a science. That child species found the Crysix too soon and looked to the Crysix as an enemy. The Crysix exterminated them as a failure.

Allorien sent a quick note to his supervisor, they did not move physically but the text displayed on the screen regardless:

> Findecáno Sadrill,
> I have found a human that is capable of using conscious magic and has the capabilities and skills to be a uniter of the species. I am reassigning myself directly to continue monitoring this individual. I will inform Fae.
> "Mahtan Allorien."

Allorien's blue ring vibrated slightly and the ship came out of a static orbit around Saturn. They cleared the satellite orbit which held them for over twenty years and sighed deeply. ‘Finally, we're making some progress.' Allorien had been watching the gas giant planets for any progress, it was his mission. There were three other Mahtan in the solar system watching Humanity, but Allorien thought they were onto something strong enough to follow it personally.

### Tethys

#### Terra Firma Dissident Prison Complex

##### Outside Dormitory J

As Gwen hopped out the window, Tim muttered something that, to Sam, sounded like gibberish. She moved to be with them and they bounded across the grass for 15 minutes to reach the edge of the fields. They were undetected, but they saw flashlights coming around the edge of the grass right behind them, near the field line. They jumped into the bushes as quickly as they could and hid. As soon as the flashlights had passed, they started thinking about this idea they had concocted and how it may not be so great after all... Sam realized they had not brought much with them. Tim had been thoughtful enough to bring a backpack with some snacks, some basic equipment, three flashlights, and a small bucket of paint.

"A bucket of paint?" Gwen inquired.

"Ah, watch." Tim said, as he poked a hole into the bottom with a screwdriver. The can begin to drip a luminescent yellow paint and he carried it as they started walking.

They started talking quietly about random stuff to pass the time. About an hour and a half after they started walking into the prairie Sam asked in a quiet voice, "What do you guys remember about before you came here?"

Gwen stopped in her tracks "What do you mean?"

"I don't have any memories from before I came here."

"Really?" Gwen spoke up, "I was an only child and my parents died before I came here. This place has been my haven."

Tim told his story as well, "My parents and I decided this would be the best place for me to come since they have an advanced history degree and I'm looking to teach history when I go back home. It had the best history program in the area."

Sam looked down feeling very left out. "Let's keep going, maybe there's an answer for me on the other side of this prairie. It feels like there is."

As the paint dripped they walked further and further away from campus. This time they walked in silence. It seemed like it would never end. About half an hour later, the can of paint was getting light and Tim said, "we need to think about heading back since we won't have a way to keep track of where we are."

Sam was walking ahead of the others in a daze and just kept going. Many things happened at once. There was a resounding thud, Sam yelled "Damn it!" and he tumbled backward onto the ground.

Tim and Gwen stood there in stunned silence. Sam had just run into... the sky.

They reached out ahead of them and felt the prairie was wall. It looked like a projection of a prairie onto a wall as they reached higher and higher the wall continued. Tim took a tennis ball out of his bag and threw it into the sky ahead of them. It bounced off the sky and ricocheted back at them with a dull thud. He threw it higher with the same effect.

All three of them looked at each other. "It really is a wall." Tim said. "If we cannot go over it, let's go under it." he produced a small collapsible shovel from his backpack. He started digging but after a couple of moments ran into concrete. He put the shovel away and said in an exasperated way "How odd...".

Gwen thought about it a second and said "If we stay along the wall there should be a seam somewhere. They all put their right hand on the wall and started walking along it. They noticed after an hour or so that it seemed to have a gentle curve to the left. "It's circular," she said.

"What if it's a dome?" Sam proposed.

Gwen stopped abruptly, "Here's the seam." two metal plates conjoined together, yet it still looked like a projection of the prairie was on it. Being this close, they could see there was a large metallic nut on the side where the teens were standing.

Tim came over to look at it. He took out a small powered drill and started drilling out one of nuts on a bolt. As soon as it came loose the bolt slipped through the wall. A massive force of suction started from the other side. Despite the small size the force knocked all three of them off their feet in surprise and they felt very cold and suddenly had a challenging time breathing. Tim was quickly rummaging though is bag for something else. He quickly pulled out a small tube and squeezed the contents into the hole. The suction stopped as epoxy filled the hole, freezing and hardening.

All three of them, dumbfounded by everything they had seen, started walking back the way they had come along the edge of the dome. They looked up and could see, knowing now that the stars they saw were not real. The clouds they saw were only an animation. The moon? Was there even a moon on the other side of the dome?

Eventually, they found their luminescent yellow paint and started tracking it back through the prairie. After about fifteen minutes of walking, Sam looked back. "It looks more real the farther we get from it." They all turned to look. "So, it does," Gwen saw, "that probably isn't a coincidence."

"What do you think it means?" Sam was the one that opened the door to hypothesis.

"Well, at the very least someone is lying to us." Gwen's brow furrowed.

"Well, taking it apart, we clearly cannot leave. Far beyond breaking the rules, physically, we cannot leave. This has changed from a school, to a prison. But that brings me to doubt many things. Is this Earth? If so, why is there a dome that has what appears to be a vacuum on the other end?"

A wave of apathy reached over them. Why had people lied to them? Why were they imprisoned?

"I don't think my parents would have agreed to me coming here if they knew what it was." Tim considered. "Something has to be wrong in my memory. They either didn't know as much about this place as they thought, or they didn't support me going."

They traveled again in silence for a while. Suddenly, they heard noise, stopped, and got down. They all crouched and listened. They could hear security guards rush nearby them, running toward the seam in the dome where they had removed the bolt. The security guards crossed in front of them but did not see the small line of luminescent paint.

After the sound had passed, Gwen rallied the boys to action. "Come on, we have to run this time." They all started running along their paint trail, trying to make as little noise as possible. Gwen reached the edge of the tall grasses first and popped out not realizing it. She quickly jumped back in and grabbed the boys to stop them. They all fell to the ground in a heap. A couple of moments later, a security guard passed the path in front of them, but did not notice them just inside the line of vegetation.

Tim was digging through his large backpack again. "I hope you guys can climb." This time, he pulled out an item that looked like a four-pronged anchor and tied it to a 50-foot rope. "Here's the plan, we run, then I throw this into the window and hook it on the metal bar under the window or the bed and we climb up." They both agreed although Sam did so slightly reluctantly. He never liked gym class.

They sprinted across the lawn and found their open window. Tim closed his eyes, muttered something under his breath. When he opened his eyes, they had an exceptional focus the other two had never seen before. He threw the grapnel into the window and a few tugs latter it stuck. He leaned his weight against it and it held.

"Okay who's first?" As he handed the rope to Sam, he muttered another line about strength and flight. Sam looked at him confused as Tim urged, "go, go quickly."

As Sam pulled himself up the rope it did not seem as hard as it was in gym class. It was the adrenaline. It was the fact that he was already tired. Or Sam thought, could it have been the words Tim said?

Gwen and Tim clambered up after Sam. Tim was reeling up the rope "You need to get back to your room quickly."

She quickly opened the door and popped his head out. "The hallways are red. We're in lock down." She closed the door again. "How do we get around this?"

"Come with me, I know the guard patterns in lock down." A female voice grabbed their attention. They spun around to see a woman with dark purple hair sitting on Tim's upper bunk bed. It was Gwen's roommate Cassandra, she was a known troublemaker in the school.

Sam started wondering things about his roommate. "Why does it seem like the world changes when you say things? What do you know that I do not? Are we really in a dome?"

"Honestly, I do not know if we are in a dome, it seems that way. I know that I have made friends with Mr. Beyar and he has said things to me that make me question if we are on Earth or even if it is the 21st century. I suspect our memories were changed." Tim artfully dodged the question about the world changing.

Tim laid down and stared into the ceiling "There is a whole different world out there, but I have no idea what state it's in."

### In orbit around Tethys

Allorien had found it. They saw the moment from above. They understood what was going on. These four young people would be able to lead Humanity to the unification they needed. For the time being, Allorien sat, and watched. That was his job after all, to watch.
