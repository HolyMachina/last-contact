# Representation

## July 4, 2278 CE

### Venus - Nova

#### Venusian Parliament Building

The breeze rushed across Senator Pace's skin. It was decontaminated but it still stung from the safe levels of acid. His 5'11" and very skinny frame shivered slightly. *I don't know how people live here all the time.* He stood on the steps of a large iron building. It was the stalwart center of the Venusian government. He was a big player from a tiny political game on Pluto. Here, he was just tiny. He shivered as he walked inside, away from the Venusian atmosphere. The air inside was fully controlled and felt more like home. *I guess they do admit their atmosphere masterwork isn't perfect.*

The atrium was large and bright, with artificial lighting. He looked around and saw various heroes of the Venusian culture standing before him, including Gabriela Jasko, the founder of Pluto's constitutional republic that made it a vassal of Venus. However, that was the only person from Pluto remembered by Venus. The rest of his people's heroes had been fully forgotten in this atrium of heroes. The very parliament of which he was a member chose not to recognize the colonies in the same way they recognize Venus. As he looked around, he saw two people standing on the balcony above him: King Romulus and Jaedon Beyar. The three of them shared a brief glance and it was enough. *Okay, we're good to go*

He turned around and, standing before him, was the Prime Minister. He had been PM since he was elected decades ago but he never adopted the tile and retained the title from his other job. "Hello Senator Le'Rue." He smiled through his surprise.

"You know them?" Le'Rue gestured to the pair in the balcony.

"At least one of them, yeah." Deception was common in this building. It wasn't a lie but what he said wasn't the whole truth either.

"I hope I have your vote on the bill today."

"You already know you don't." Senator Pace was blunt and accusatory. "It abandons two children for your own political protection by locking out opposing thought. You sacrifice life for your own safety."

"Well, one can always hope." Le'Rue ignored the point.

"Hope for someone to change their underlying values and principles?" Senator Pace asked.

"Happens all the time here." After a brief pause, the head of the Venusian senate continued "Shouldn't principles and values change with new facts?"

"Uh, no." Senator Pace realized the plan was starting to work. "You're confusing values and principles with policy goals."

"Excuse me?" The most senior Senator Le'Rue glowered at junior Senator Pace from the vassal state of Pluto.

"Goals are shorter term and change and seek to work toward values using facts, policies, past experience, and action. Values are durable and can never be achieved, they are large and something you always strive toward. It's a common misconception for people with no, or unclear, values. They have a tendency to think goals are values." Senator Pace walked away. He knew that he had made a political enemy today. He just didn't expect Le'Rue to be so easy to aggravate.

From the upper balcony, King Romulus and Jaedon shared a smirk as Le'Rue bristled alone in the middle of the atrium. It was an uncharacteristic moment of vulnerability for the prime minister.

#### Senate Chambers

As Senator Pace walked into the large senate chambers, he knew he had left Le'Rue a little shaken. He focused on the large dais in front of him. It opened along a wall where a series of display panels hung: They showed the emblems of different political units within Venus while all the emblems of the vassal states were present but muted. There was no mention of the political factions within each colony. A semi-circle of desks were setup facing the podium, with a larger desks on one side of the room. Such formation for senate chambers has served its purpose well during all human history. His desk was in the back, near the middle of the semi circle, on the main aisle. As he took his seat, people passed by as they entered. Senator Pace hated the small talk. He engaged anyway for anyone that directly engaged him as they passed.

About half an hour later, Senator Le'Rue entered. He always made sure he was the last one on the floor. He shook hands and small talked his way down the center aisle but he intentionally bypassed Senator Pace. Senator Pace looked up to the balcony to see the King and Jaedon looking down from above. There were a couple bangs of the gavel as Senator Le'Rue reached the dias and called the senate into session. "Order! Order! I officially commence this session of the Senate of Venus." The murmuring began to die down. *It's time* Senator Pace thought. "We only have one item on the agenda today. The item is arranging for the release of Gwendolyn Romulus, Princess of Venus, from imprisonment by Terra Firma."

The king of Venus stood on the balcony looking down upon the representatives of his people. A voice boomed from the back of the floor. It was Senator Pace, "We know who they are, we should arrange for their release as well. I do not care what we must give them, the war will be over if we have all three of them. Get them here safely, don't take risks."

From the podium in front of the Senate chamber, came the response of Senator Le'Rue "Senator Pace, we don't have the ability. Think about what we must give up just to get our princess back. " He was a short round man with a deep voice and a frustrated tone. Senator Pace was interrupting his flow of leading the other Senators.

After the arrest of Samuel Knudsen had hit the news, the Venusian government requested the release of three inmates from Terra Firma's super high security prison for political prisoners. Unexpectedly, the leader of the Terra Firma government, Chancellor Fulton, had responded with two options. Those choices displayed on the board behind Senator Le'Rue.

"Let us start the vote." Senator Le'Rue dictated. The room was large, but everyone could see the display. The entire wall behind the podium was a screen to project anything they needed at any given time. A panel flipped over on each senator's desk, including Le'Rue's. Each panel had three buttons: one red, one blue and one green. The detail of the three options appeared on the wall behind the leader of the Venusian Senate.

The red choice, on the left, was for the "NO DEAL." Gwendolyn Romulus, Timothy Li, and Samuel Knudsen would remain imprisoned by the Terra Firma Government. Terra Firma state channels would not start broadcasting on our media. Venus would not surrender ownership of Mars to Terra Firma. Names started coming up for this choice, with the planet they represented, most of which were senators from the martian colony. Northern Mars thought any deal was a beginning of the end to their sovereignty.

The blue choice, in the middle, was for the "Partial Deal". Terra Firma would free Gwen Romulus and they would repatriate her. Timothy Li and Samuel Knudsen would remain imprisoned by the Terra Firma Government. Terra Firma state channels would begin to broadcast on Venus and its colonies. As names started coming up, they were mostly senators from Venus.

The green choice, on the right, was for the "Full Deal". Terra Firma would release Gwen Romulus and repatriate her. Terra Firma would also release Timothy Li and Samuel Knudsen into the custody of the Venusian military, and they would be given the choice to return home. Terra Firma state channels would begin to broadcast on Venus and its colonies. Senator Pace's name was the only one that appeared for this choice.

After a couple of minutes, the voting started slowing down and the numbers stabilized. It was clear that the partial deal was winning. Le'Rue's name popped up there shortly after and there were enough votes to seal the deal. The smirk on Le'Rue's face was one of contempt for anyone who could consider voting against him. He turned that smirk up to his king making the king shivered.

A few minutes later the vote was finalized. Le'Rue's gavel struck the table and he pronounced victory. "Thank you all. We will plan for the release of our princess."

Senator Pace glowered at Le'Rue from the back of the room. Everything had gone according to the plan. Le'Rue was starting to make mistakes. It was clear Venus was abandoning the colonies. If Terra Firma media started reaching them, nobody knew what could happen next.

Le'Rue stepped down from the podium and exited from one of the wing doors. His stride was extremely confident. Venus' strength was still strong enough to hold everyone together, even if there was a clear divide between who was and who was not represented there. The colonies that had no representation were already upset. The king knew this was an opening he could exploit.
