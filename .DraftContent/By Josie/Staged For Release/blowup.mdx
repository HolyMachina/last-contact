# Blow Up

## August 20, 2273 CE

### Terra Firma

#### Impulse Tower

1983 saw the construction of the 664-foot-high tower. It has never closed since it opened. The labeling “Impulse” was over the main door although the letters “MP” were of a different font as if it was reused from a time past before the rest of the lettering was. Resting on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 56th street, a former Gucci store was now a governmental agency for complaints. It is not a popular place, because everyone who goes in there, never came out.

The company of a former president owned the tower until the US government bought it to serve a purpose. The building was no longer mixed use. It was a fully governmental building. The vast majority of the Terra Firma Empire was moved to New York City after a previous president lost faith in the civil servant core in Washington D.C.

Six generals walked up to a golden elevator. They pressed no button, but the elevator knew they were there. They were all bald white men of about the same height and build. They wore four different uniforms. Though the uniforms had recently changed they still showed the same meanings. The dominant colors stood for the government's control over current aspects of their agency. All of them were complete except one. A dark blue uniform to show the entirety of the planets oceans; light blue over the skies; green over the entire land of the planet. The last uniform had some poorly sown on patches. A half circle patch was red, a large full circle was orange, and a small full circle was gray. The patches marred the beauty of the full black uniform symbolizing the control of space. The patches were a symbol of failure that every member of the entire branch of the Terra Firma Space Military had to physically and emotionally wear.

The doors opened and the six generals stepped inside. The elevator took them to the four floor penthouse, at the top of the tower. The penthouse served a dual purpose of residence of the Chancellor of Terra Firma and the seat of the entire government of the planet formerly named Earth. The six of them received direction to come up here for a meeting scheduled to last four hours. When the elevator doors opened they saw a tall man in a business suit. Even though he was tall, his frame was very thin, his long black hair was a symbol of how long he had been sitting as Chancellor of Terra Firma. “Conquer them, like I conquer you.”

Chancellor Fulton raised a weapon to one of the generals wearing the black uniform. He pulled the trigger and the general fell to the floor of the elevator. “See? It's easy.” The doors closed and the elevator began to move back down. The Chancellor sighed. “I hate having to make statements and shows like that.” He turned to his chief of staff. “Master Vera'Cruz, appoint a new vice chairman of the joint chiefs, make sure he comes from the same branch. The vice anything can always a symbol.”

##### Floor 19 - Science Wing

His research books and scientific experiments would have been unheard of, even as late as the 21st Century. An older man at a lab table looking at a new book entitled “A History of Light” published on the history of the years 100 B.C. - 100 A.D. It had been published by a rival of his from back in school. They went to University together and were the first two graduates of the new degree, Doctorate in Religious Sciences. He was now the chair of the department for the only university in the world that offered the degree.

His study was to line up history, science, and theology. He was of Ukrainian descent and had always had an interest, however, he was one of the first that that had major breakthroughs. This first book and breakthrough of his rival lined up with his tenth in the field. His study was to perfect a series of beliefs that aligned with science and gave all that religion needed to provide. There was a correct answer and a boundary line between science and religion. There was also a way to scientifically prove the importance, value, and beliefs that religion held.

Religion in history has explained the things science could not. It gave comfort when science could not. It gave answers when facts could not. Most people thought that as science answered a question that question was no longer the domain of religion. Dr. Palnov knew this to be fraud. Religion is there to define principles and beliefs that people could use to influence their decision making progress. How those principals were formed didn't matter. Religion and science were partners, not enemies. Religions had come and gone, most of the time because, they conflicted with the political systems of the day. He knew more than anyone else on the planet on the interplay of history, science, and religion.

He was proud of his recent accomplishments, yet his boss was holding them back from the public. He was angry with the government which paid him and funding his experiments. Apparently this order came from the top. Chancellor Fulton himself had decided that this research would not be released. Dr. Palnov bristled at the thought. It was this research that was able to identify the risk to the Empire in 2274. The beginnings of this research was able to identify three children that would, in the future, pose a clear and present danger to the Empire. And now this dramatic and powerful research was being held back from the public that this government professed to serve. Why would you ever want to hold back knowledge? They were not letting him say what he saw. He looked up to his wall, and saw the quote that has inspired him most over the course of his life. “See first, think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting or what you could test.”

His blood boiled as he read this new book. It completely discounted the Bible as entirely fiction. There was even a forward written by some unknown expert named "Fae" who in the world was this person and what was this ridiculous pen name? Dr. Palnov knew portions of the Bible to be true. His research had been in the safe extraction, processing, and return of a humans memories of their current, and past lives. It wasn't until recently they were able to identify past lives. Once they did it was groundbreaking. He used that information to start harvesting information from people and then used an artificial intelligence system to start projecting who these people would become and what they might do. That discovery lead to another, he wrote his report and it went to the Chancellor. He still didn't like being the cause of the arrest of three people; but what people did with his discoveries was up to them.

In the discovery that was ready for mass publication but being held back, Dr. Palnov had found the memories of a major player in the Bible. Not in physical life, but in the buried memories of a past life of a student of his. His student had allowed him to harvest his memories, and found that past life. His rival and this "Fae" person had used the opening that some of the facts of the Bible were incorrect to discount the entire bible. Dr. Palnov knew that this person and Fae had been wrong. There were some parts of the bible that were factually accurate. He found them in the memories of this person. Who, did not have access to any of these memories himself. If only he could release his work. It would prove that reincarnation of souls was real, and that he had recently found the reincarnation of one of the most famous people in the world.

His supervisor a young man in his thirties, burst into the room. He walked up to the other side of the lab table. “Good, you're reading it, what can we use to defeat it? This will undermine the entirety of the Unified Christian church and possibly our whole Empire” Dr. Palnov. looked up at him the blood boiled to his face making him appear unapproachable.

“I already handed you the information you needed to defeat this drivel. You did not let me publish one of my greatest studies. Publishing my study will negate this book.” He threw his study across the table at his supervisor. “No more work is required.” The report “Studies into ancient memories and auras; proof of reincarnation and magic.” slid across the table. His supervisor scoffed at it. "You know that Chancellor Fulton prevented the release of this. We need something else. Get to it."

His supervisor left in a huff and Dr. Palnov stood up and walked over to the window of the 19th floor of Impulse Tower. He stared out wishing there was just a way to get this information out there. He stood there for a good ten minutes looking across the city of New York. Then he heard a voice seeking to get his attention.

"I'm bored, you wanna blow up the world with me?" A long dark haired woman was standing in his doorway with a ripped up skirt and loose fitting mesh top.

"Miss Fulton?" He recognized her in a moment as the Chancellors daughter.

She rushed up into his face holding a gun to his chest. "Don't you dare call me that again." He stepped back from her and she relaxed. "So, I wanna try something fun. Wanna blow up the world?"

"What do you mean?"

She started walking away from him back toward the door. "Well, your report. I heard about it. I'm bored. I want to do something fun. So, I'm going to publish it. It's gonna cause waves, it's going to make news, it's going to change lives, oh and yes, there will be riots. But, I'm going to release it." Before he knew it, she was gone. And so was his report.

He knew he should report this to his supervisor and the chancellor. He should. He took a long moment to consider it. He decided not to report it.

Cassandra Fulton's head popped back around the door for a second and she said "Oh and I have someone I want you to meet. I'll setup a time." Then she was gone as fast as she appeared.
