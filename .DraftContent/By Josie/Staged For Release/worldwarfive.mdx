# World War Five

## June 5, 2280 CE

### Mars, Dorsa Argentea

#### Planum Castle

##### Prince’s Quarters

Looking down from his deep blue eyes Jamie Hedlund could see the domed cities of Schmidt, Fontana, Von Karman and Phillips built into the craters pockmarking the south western hemisphere of Mars. He was the heir to the throne, the only prince of Mars. Yet, his role was that of a mouth piece, and his planet was always at war. He looked up and saw the usual combat formation of ships battling over the horizon near the equator. Somehow it was a constant stalemate between the ships of Venus and the ships of Terra Firma. The southern half of Mars was one of the largest colonies of Terra Firma and the northern half was one of the largest colonies of Venus. It’s too bad, he didn’t understand why they had to fight. He’d watched nineteen years of this pointless struggle, he’d watched it since the day he was born.

The large gilded doors to his room opened his mother, the Queen of Mars, and his father, who was not the King, walked in. Turning, his messy brown hair shuffled slightly. His parents, also blue eyes, both looked concerned. “Mom, Dad, what’s going on?”  

His dad approached first holding out a book.” This is a gift for you. “It comes from a friend of mine.” The only reason he wasn’t a king is because he wasn’t allowed to be. He wasn’t a citizen of Mars, or even Terra Firma. He was a citizen of Venus, but particularly Venus’ colony on Pluto. “Suffice to say, if anyone found out where this came from we would be in trouble.” The only reason his father is still alive is because his mom promised indefinite allegiance to the Chancellor of Terra Firma to save the life of the man he loved.

His mom spoke next. “We considered withholding this gift, it is after all just a blank book.” Jamie opened the black covered book to confirm, it was indeed blank. There weren't any markings on the cover or spine either. A confused expression crossed Jamie’s face. His mother continued, “but after discussing it a bit. We are hoping you will finally be the bridge between our two cultures.”

“I doubt it.” Jamie pointed out the window. “How would I get them to stop fighting if neither group takes their orders from me?”

“That’s the question I’ve struggled with since I became Queen. There is no good answer to that one.” She turned to leave. “I’m not sure what purpose that book will serve, but knowing the person it’s from it may eventually have that answer.”

Jamie looked down at the book opening it again and flipping though it. All the pages were still blank. “What do you mean by that?” He looked up to see that his mother and father had already left.

He went to his desk with the book and studied it some more. Flipping though each page they were indeed all blank. The pages felt different, it was almost as if they had a plastic layer around them, a lamination. However, none existed.

He tossed the book and caught it confused by it. All of a sudden it became warm. Jamie dropped the book due to the surprise. The black spine turned a mocha color.  

He looked inside and the first page had writing on it “Hi. Please write in me.” Moments later the text disappeared.

He sat down at his desk with a orange colored pen in hand and stared down at the pages. They had no further insight to share.

Jamie wrote, “Who are you?” The words shimmered for a moment on the page then vanished.

“I am a friend of your father’s. This book will help us communicate the vast physical distances between us. Just write in it and my spine will change color. Likewise the other direction.”

“Where are you?”

One word appeared. “Pluto.” In disbelief it vanished before his eyes after he read it. Although, it took much longer for him to process the meaning.

Jamie’s writing got sloppier as he wrote quickly “How can you really be there? No communication can go that fast. Who are you really? How are you doing this? What’s your goal? Funny prank. I’ll get my dad back later.”

“No prank.”

“How?”

“Magic... isn’t just fairy tales.”

“Why should I believe you?”

“Because your father put himself at great risk to get us this opportunity to talk.”

“I’m done.”

Just before he the book he saw the last message he would get for a while from this book. “It was nice to meet you.”

### Mars

#### Planum Castle

#### Media Room

Jamie sat in front of a wall of fifteen television screens arranged on a wall in a large recliner with a bunch of buttons on the arm. All fifteen screens had different content. All of them had closed captioning on. Six TVs had a green outline and their sound was sent to one speaker each around the room. Jamie was gifted with the ability to consume multiple streams of information at once. This was how he kept himself informed; he had never been allowed out of the castle. He was too important and too young. He was fourteen. He was a prince. His planet was at war. He felt the desire to consume everything he could within the walls of his castle.

The green border focused on just one of the screens as the audio turned up for that specific broadcast. He wanted to focus specifically on what the Venusian News Network was saying. "The fifth human civil war, is raging still on Mars and throughout the solar system in periodic battles in space." The Venusian media agencies dropped the "World War" nomenclature when Venus was founded. They started calling wars between all of humanity "Human Civil Wars." The people of Venus. Jamie always thought it was weird that the people of Venus, after all they had been though, considered Terra Firma and all the other planets their same people. The planet of Mars was the only one that had access to every human news agency in the solar system. Most news agencies focused on a specific planet, region, or governmental body, Mars was half owned by the Terra Firma Empire and half by the Venusian Republic.

The images of the active TV showed a section of the martian landscape that had a field of wrecked spacecraft that had fallen to the surface of Mars, it was dotted with spacecraft of both Venusian and Terra Firma emblems. "It's a shame, this fight has caused so much death, pain, and loss on both sides of the conflict" the reporter said. "At least it doesn't harm the people that live on Mars" Jamie muttered under his breath. He paused this screen on the screenshot and started clicking though other screens. As the voices changed so fast nobody would be able to keep up.

He landed on a Terra Firma broadcast showing the exact same view of ruined ships and on the field of Mars. The broadcaster said, "it is clear Terra Firma is proving to be extremely victorious." He paused that one and now the two shots were exactly side by side. He clicked a few buttons and expanded both the images so that they took up the full size of the fifteen screens. The Venusian image had a few less Venusian ships downed than Terra Firma ships. The Terra Firma broadcast had 4 Venusian ship downed for each Terra Firma ship.

"Hey Dad!" Jamie called out the door.

"Yes Jamie?"

"Hey, come here."

The figurehead King of Mars stepped into the room. "Oh boy, what were you watching?"

"The News," Jamie responded sarcastically.

"You're too young to be watching this kind of stuff." He sat down in a smaller recliner next to the big one. "You don't have to worry about all this stuff yet. You'll need to deal it eventually, why do it now?"

Jamie turned to him looking extremely serious. "How can I be ready to lead our people then, if I don't prepare now?"

"You are a very mature and well thought out young man."

Jamie breezed past the compliment and pointed at the screens. "Can you get me the real image of what they're showing there."

"Sure, I'll send a drone out there this afternoon to get an image." The King looked up to the screens. "They're both clearly lying. Why do you care?"

"Even if they're both lying... who's lying more still matters."
