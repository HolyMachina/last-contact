# Other Side

## November 4, 2285

### Pluto

#### Nova (Planetary Capitol City)

##### Discovery Tower

The entire top floor of Discovery tower was reserved for his offices and staff. The office was purpose fit and for the senator from the great republic of pluto. His desk was clean and bookshelves were extremely tidy. Senator Andrew Pace was a tall man, but his height wasn't obvious because he was sitting at his desk.  A handgun sat on his desk next to him, however, it had all the firing components and mechanisms removed. Guns had been banned on Pluto since the initial Constitution was written. Senator Pace sat over a book with a fountain pen. He looked down at the black, blank, leather-bound book _itâ€™s almost time._ the book said in Jamie's handwritten text.

_I'm ready._ He clicked a button on the communications system on his desk. "We're leaving. Power it up."

"Yes, sir." an assistant responded. Moments later a set of yellow lights turned on in the room and an automated message played. "Prepare for detachment and departure."

He looked back into the book and wrote with the fountain pen. _I'll be to the other side as planned._
