The room was sterile, yet it was a room of both religion and science. Dr. Palnov dark eyes were wide. "They already know more than I hoped was true." On Terra Firma he was the most knowledgeable person about the bridge between science and religion. Here, he was over 150 years behind in research. He was reading a book entitled "Compiled recordings regarding aural energy manifested in humans."
He waved a wide wand around his arm. A screen nearby showed him there existed a layer of invisible energy around his arm. It was visible on the scanner and surprised him to be a blue white in color. Dr. Palnov had a second skin. As he moved the scanner over his body he noted that the layer of energy varied in thickness but ranged from 1-2 centimeters to as much as 30 centimeters in some places near his heart and head.
The field interacted like water, if he pressed it with his finger it would displace. It passed straight though his clothes, in fact, as he took off his jacket it appeared a liquid substance covered the jacket even though no substance existed in the physical realm. He pushed down on the field on his arm. Pressure formed and the energy bubbled outward. When his finger met his arm the energy sealed and became one layer instead of two.
Dr. Palnov turned the handheld scanner to a nearby fern. The small plant also had a similar field, but the plant's field was more static in nature. It was a greenish hue and interacted more like a gel. As Dr. Palnov lightly pressed on the field it pressed on the fronds themselves and the plant tried to move slowly away.
Setting up the wand to watch a frond at a high magnification he pressed on the frond from both sides at once. As the energies compressed upon each other he found that the one from the frond moved slower. It was harder and resisted movement much more than his own energy. He found that the first layer that broke was his own energy field. His finger was physically touching the fern's energy field but had not yet touched the frond itself. He wondered if the physical feeling he was receiving which could be as an oily feeling was the energy field of this plant.
As he pressed harder on the field it hardened further. It was defending itself. It did not take much force to break though and once it did the field shattered around his finger. His field, and the field of the plant closed into one and melded at the combination, as if there was a symbiosis. He felt like by touching the plant he could feel a little bit of what it was thinking. It rejected him at first, but now, they were honest acquaintances.
How had he never realized this? He was so close. Too bad the management of Terra Firma had decided to prevent his research from continuing. If only he had this information years ago. He with a couple of changes to the belief system he could have proved that the Unified Christian Church was scientifically correct. For some reason, unknown to him, it seemed like religion and science was always at war.
He went on to read, that while an energy field surrounded each living being, each field had a different "finger print." Upon death, this energy is the first thing to leave the body and is the weight released, which science could never explain before. This field ceased to be. It was the light and physical manifestation of a being's soul. It powered so many things.
He clicked a button on the wand that said "Register" and his aural fingerprint added into the database in the wand. He yawned and started cleaning up for the night. He could not wait to see what his energy field could do.
