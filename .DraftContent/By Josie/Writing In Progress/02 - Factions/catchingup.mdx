Venus - Avalon
His blue robes flowed in the wind, the silver symbols adoring it sparkled as they moved. He was standing on a landing pad just outside the castle’s walls. A small extremely fast craft came in at an absurd entry angle. It created a large black cloud in the decontaminated Venusian atmosphere.
The ship was from Terra Firma, it was a diplomatic landing, yet a military craft was landing. Their newest model of craft called the Rotor had engines which twisted around on ball joints. Just as much as Terra Firma needed to deliver the goods they were giving to Venus, they wanted to show off their latest model of assault vehicle.
As it came in to land it did a couple of loops the King of Venus made split second eye contact with the pilots. He read their feelings and heard, “well this is where we may reveal our weakness.” The king stepped forward smirking. The ball joints had jets shooting liquid into them to keep the joint mobile. Quickly the King produced an idea. What if they found a way to cut off those jets of liquid, oil?
King Romulus was only 5’3” but his presence was intimating in other ways. He had short dark hair; yet his robe reached the ground. His daughter was in the 3rd seat. As the ship landed all its engines pointed down to control decent and the Kings robes fluttered around him in the jet wash. The third cockpit opened extremely quickly, and Gwen jumped straight to the ground instead of waiting for a ladder. She ran over and embraced her father, although she was slightly taller than he was.
She took his hand “I love you dad, what happened?”
“They took you from me and you were imprisoned. We had to give up a lot to get you back, but we did.” She started crying into his shoulder. They walked hand in hand toward the castle in happy silence.
