October 10, 2559 C.E.
Charon Orbit - The Pinnacle
An explosion rocked the western quadrant of Charon. It was roughly one hundred meters in diameter and created one of the largest craters Charon had ever seen. Standing just to the side of where the explosion ended were Tim, Gwen, and General Parino.
"Fire is your second strongest element. You're still afraid of it. You can do better." The general scolded Tim. They were all standing within a water bubble which contained a small pocket of breathable air. There were lines of energy connecting the walls of the water bubble to Gwen's hands and the General's hands. "This is almost fully coming from you." The trails from Gwen's hands were thick and nearly solid with energy. As the general's vanished she said, "It's all yours dear. Your power keeps us alive."
She turned toward Tim. "Tim, I know you're scared. I know your past but if you don't learn the upper extents of your power you'll never be able to control it. Relax and channel all of your fire into it. There is nothing that will result in our deaths." Tim took a moment and inhaled a large breath. He held out his hand palm up and a small fireball appeared. It was a spark. He held his breath and flung the small fireball forward. It flew roughly two hundred meters and struck the ground as Tim exhaled. Energy sparked off of him and raced toward the small spark of a flame. It combusted with such force that all three of them were thrown off their feet. Gwen lost her concentration and the bubble around them vanished. They all struggled to breathe for a brief moment but it was quickly restored by the general.
As the three of them got back to their feet it was clear, Charon was dying. The blast had taken a large chunk out of the small moon. It was fracturing and clearly out of orbit. "Look, this is what happens when I stop restricting myself. I break things." Tim yelled at General Parino. "There is no reason that this should have happened. How are we going to get off this dying moon? We will be lost forever!"
All of a sudden a ship came down from orbit. It was The Pinnacle. As the moon fractured further Allorien landed and his cockpit dissolved. The three of them climbed aboard. The cockpit reformed around them and General Parino let the bubble go. Gwen was the first one to speak. "Why are you here?"
"I've been watching. It is my job after all." Allorien said in a calm voice.
"Well, you saved our lives." Tim scoffed, "from me."
As they pulled away from Charon General Parino observed, "Charon is now in four pieces and will never return to orbit. Excellent work Tim." She only received a glare in response.
