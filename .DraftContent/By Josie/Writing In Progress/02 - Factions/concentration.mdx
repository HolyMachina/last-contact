The young prince looked at the brown book on his shelf. It had never turned black again. He laid down to bed, it was that time. As he fell asleep, he looked at the book on that far away shelf. He wondered where it came from and who was communicating with him.
In his dreams he saw a large city. He looked down upon it from the top of the largest city. “He never wrote back.” It was a voice that the prince had never heard before. Prince Hedlund turned around he saw a tall thin man. The unknown man was staring out the window. Jamie looked around to find a mostly empty room that had a desk and a couple of bookshelves. Jamie walked over to the desk and saw a nameplate that said “Senator Pace”
The man walked over to his bookshelf and took a brown book that looked identical to Jamie’s. He took it down and began to write in it. The first line he wrote was “Please do not close the book until you have read the full message.”
Jamie awoke with a start. The room was cold. He had left the window open. He got up to close the window and noticed the book was black now. He took it off the shelf. The first line in the book was “Please do not close this book until you’ve read the full message.” The prince had to look at it twice. Was his dream real? He continued reading.
“I’m not sure why you haven’t responded however I am thinking that last time I wrote you a message you closed the book out of surprise instead of reading all the directions. I have imbued this book with magic designed to transfer thoughts from one place to another. Yes, magic exists. If you write into the book the words will be transferred into my book in my office and it will turn black, just like yours does when I write. My name is Andrew Pace. I am a Senator in the government of Venus representing Pluto. Using this tool, we can communicate back and forth without anyone knowing. I was a close friend of your fathers before your life.”
He closed the book and placed it back on the shelf. There was only one place for him to go but he didn’t feel like it would be helpful. The young prince wondered the castle for about an hour ignoring everyone while he walked. Jamie ended up in his media room and flipped on the televisions and saw a familiar face.
Senator Pace was speaking at the podium of the Venusian Senate, “We are letting everyone down.” Behind him was the board, a vote had a just concluded. In front of the board was the sponsors of two choices. Sen Le’Rue’s smug face glowered down above him. Senator Le’Rue had just won a narrow victory, by one vote the Venusian Senate had voted to commence military actions against Terra Firma. “If we commence military action this war will never end. We must open more negotiations.” The sponsor of this bill, a senator from Venus, shook her head knowing it was a lost cause.
Senator Pace continued, “We will make no progress continuing to fight. It will perpetuate the status quo.” He pointed at the third option for which there were no votes. “We should reach out to the royalty of South Mars. If we can turn the tide there we can win though diplomacy. Nobody voted for the status quo, why would you do so by voting for military combat. What convinced you all that this was the right choice?” A bell sounded signifying it was the end of his time and he said “Thank you for your time.” He stepped down from the podium his head was down.
Jamie took out a piece of paper and started writing drafts of something shredding them after considering them failed. Thirty minutes later Jamie stood up and walked with dedication back to his room.
