March 10, 2558. C.E.
Tethys (3rd Moon of Saturn) - Thunder Bay
Mr. Beyar was tall, and had an athletic build. He had dark hair and blue eyes. He did not like this room. It was a large amphitheater type room. The walls were all white and there was an antique projector from the early 21st century in the ceiling that projected up to the front of the room. There was also a Christian cross above the door. He had very little respect for religion in the 26th century but understood historically the value it gave people.
He stood waiting for his first class of the new term to filter in. There was a secret in his smile; everyone had an idea what the secret was, but they were all wrong. His secret was that he was not an average history teacher, in an average college. He stood as he waited for his students to filter in.
Looking at the roster, all three of his favorite students were in this class group. They walked in together chatting about how nice the weather was. He smiled that secret smile again. He called the class to order "Okay boys and girls, let us get started." Everyone very promptly pulled out their notebooks and pencils and prepared to take notes.
He started lecturing about the course of human events in the nineteen-sixties. His curriculum very clearly ended in the nineteen-eighties, because his students thought it was 2004. The classroom was completely silent except for the droning voice of Mr. Beyar. Normally he is a lot more excited about history but he cannot teach the last five hundred plus years of history because, to these students... to them it is not history, it is future.
About 20 minutes into his lecture one of the students fell asleep. His head hit the desk with a resounding thud. Sharp intake of air. Door flung open. Men in suits. Student dragged out. Door Slam. Deep Exhale. Mr. Beyar laughed slightly, "hopefully we won't have that happen again."
The events surprised the students in the moment but the class returned to normal quickly. This was the situation in the school. If people broke a rule, no matter how slight, security removed them from class to an unknown location. The students may, or may not, ever come back. As Mr. Beyar was wrapping up his lecture, the bell rang to change classes. He was as happy as any of the students that his lecture was over. However, there was one he wanted to see just a little bit more. "Tim, if possible can you stay after class."
There was the requisite taunting from the other students but they did quickly get up and leave. His two friends who he walked in with looked back and Tim fidgeted slightly in his chair. Mr. Beyar was happy to see that Sam and Gwen showed concern about Tim. He quickly responded with "Don't worry you aren't in trouble. Tim waived his friends on and they left the room more at ease.
Mr. Beyar got up and motioned Tim to follow him. "Please come to my office." Tim gathered his things and got up slowly. The walk through the first couple of hallways was an odd one, it passed in silence.
"Did I do something, sir?"
Mr. Beyar laughed with a certain timber that carried the â€˜I wish I could tell you the truth.' message. After the laugh had passed he responded with "No, of course not, you are a wonderful student. In fact, I would like you mentor you in a couple of things that I think you might be interested in learning."
Tim looked at him questioningly. "Are you, sure, that's okay?"
"Yeah," Mr. Beyar answered, "I have noticed you can do some things that seem odd or strange, can't you?" They were now outside of the building walking down a path way near the largest building on campus, they passed a giant tower with a great deal of emergency sirens and bells. Tim seemed a little zoned out, and Mr. Beyar threw a punch at his face. Tim blocked it with a super-human reaction time.
"It is those skills which I would like to grow in you. What if I said you are magic?"
