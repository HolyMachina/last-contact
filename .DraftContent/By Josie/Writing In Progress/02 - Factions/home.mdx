Gwen smiled broadly as Sam, Tim, and Mr. Beyar came down the stairs from Edith. Her Tiara sparkled in the bright lighting of the landing bay. She moved forward but was held back by her father. "Dear, you are royalty, you should patiently wait for them to come to you. Don't let your excitement to see them show too much it will make negotiations difficult later in your life if your emotions show though too much." She paused. They walked toward her slowly everyone was following Jaedon. He was the only one that had been here before the rest were lost in how a hidden landing pad would be so ornate.
"Dad, while I understand your point, these are my friends. I am not negotiating with anyone here."
"Okay good point, but you never know what your future will hold. With that said, go ahead."
She smiled broadly at him and ran forward. Her dress fluttered in the recirculated air. It wasn't long before she covered the distance and hugged both Sam and Tim at the same time. "I'm so glad you got out. I've missed you so much."
They were both taken aback by this sudden display of affection. Her little brother giggled and pointed at her. Everyone turned to stare. She blushed deeply and jumped back and started walking with them. "I was so surprised when they gave me my memories back. To think this is the family I come from… Did they give you yours back too?"
Tim was the first to respond, they walked slowly, "They didn't give them back, they were stolen for us. When we began to watch them as a video, they came back."
"I wish they didn't," Sam said in a quiet voice.
"Sam, you're here now and safe. Whatever was in your past, it can't hurt you anymore." Gwen tried to reassure him.
Sam glowered at Gwen. "Your past can always hurt you."
They continued walking in silence until they reached the rest of the group. Alestra was speaking with The King when they arrived. "Your home is very impressive."
"I get lucky that I was born into it. I would trade it all to support those I love and respect, if that's what is required."
"Sam, Tim, this is my father the King of Venus, Moren and my little brother, Siawn." Moren and Siawn both nodded.
"Welcome to our home. I've heard wonderful things about you both. Gwen brought home many stories of your times together and the things you discovered in that hellish place. You were all very strong." Moren smiled broadly. "The next thing I need to tell you is that you are about to walk though an aural barrier." They all began to walk together. "It will take your spiritual fingerprint and register you to the castle. "Okay Alestra, Allorien, Tim, and Sam wait here." They all stopped walking but the rest continued. The king pulled a small tablet like device out of his pocket, everyone else walked with him then they all stopped and turned around. "Just Alestra, walk forward and keep walking until you feel normal again."
As she walked forward she shivered a a ding happened on the device in the Moren's hand. He looked down at the the device and Alestra paused and stopped in her tracks. "Keep Walking," he commanded. Three seconds later a beeping went off on the pad and she got flung off her feet backward away from the the king, his children, and her mentor. She landed with a thud and groan on the asphalt of the landing pad.
Jaedon was the one that explained, "The system rejected you because it didn't get a good read on your aura." She gathered herself to her feat, the only thing wounded was her pride. This time, she ran. As she hit the same barrier the device dinged again and Moren quickly clicked a button accepting her aural signature into the system. The other two followed her shortly thereafter learning the lesson Sam and Tim both moved quickly. Again, the aural fingerprint was accepted directly into the system by the king.
When it came time for Allorien to pass though the king realized the flaw. "Oh, I don't know how this thing works with aliens." Allorien shrugged. They said in a warm voice, "I presume it would be inadvisable for the system to know I was here, or existed." The king nodded.
Allorien stood for a moment staring at the barrier, then looked down at Tim and said, "On the other hand, I guess I've interacted with humanity this much. A little more will not hurt, maybe it will help to expedite correct actions" The king smiled at them broadly.
Allorien held their hand up to where the invisible barrier was. A small section of the barrier turned a bright red, it was a bubble of energy that seemed to radiate around in a sphere at all entry points of the castle. As he stood there he looked at the humans again. "I know this magic, it is a base magic to read the aura of people. Like you I have an aura." As they said this a white bubble appeared around them. "This," he pointed to the barrier, "is your home's aura. It only allows in those it accepts." They smiled with eyes of excitement.
"To allow myself access without your home knowing I have access I shield myself, with armor from the castle itself." As he said some of the red energy came off of the barrier around the castle and created a bubble around their white aura. "Your home will not even know I am here as long as I am enshrined in your home's energy. He put his hand down and started walking forward, both the barriers disappeared. "When I concentrate I can make the energy manifest to your eyes. But, trust me, even though you cannot see it, it is still there." They reached the point where the barrier should have created a notification for the king to approve or deny. No notification came. The barrier did not reject Allorien. In fact the barrier of the castle did not realize that Allorien was there at all.
The group of nine walked together though the underground landing pad the proceeding into the castle. They walked in relative quiet. Jaedon and Alestra were walking with Moren leading the pack. They were speaking briefly about things that have changed since they were on Venus. They were congratulated for their successful assignment and told they had a ‘surprise' coming, but the details were neglected. Allorien was holding up the back doing what the thing they did best. Allorien watched, silently.
The four children were silent in the middle. The first of the four children to speak up was Siawn "So, sis, which ones your boyfriend?" This made Gwen blush and the other two stop in their tracks. Gwen stared at her little brother. After that she yelled "I'm going to get you," and ran to grab him. He dodged her and ran ahead of the adults laughing. The elder sister, acting less like a princess and more like an embarrassed sibling chased after him. Shortly there after they find their way to the royal banquet hall and sit down to a large family dinner, however there were four other people around the table.
