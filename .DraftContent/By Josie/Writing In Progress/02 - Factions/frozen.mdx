The voice boomed across the penthouse "Kill them all!"
"What?" Vera'Cruz was shocked. He was standing right in front of Chancellor Fulton's desk, but felt like he didn't hear the Chancellor correctly.
"They were planning to use the towers as a coup. Kill all the generals, kill all the architects, kill them all."
"I can't agree with that action."
"Okay, call the meeting. I'll do it myself."
"Is that really the wisest plan?"
"Yes. Leadership though fear requires immediate and extreme correction of issues." He drew his gun against Vera'Cruz. "Including the smallest issues like being questioned."
Vera'Cruz leaned into the weapon. "Try it. I dare you."
Chancellor Fulton's eyes tightened slightly. "Okay then." After a second his eyes widened with surprise. "Why can't I pull the trigger?"
"I have used magic — the thing our government claims doesn't exist. It's a relatively simple stunning spell that prevents you from moving motor muscle groups. The biggest problem with leadership thought fear is the toll it takes on you, and that it can be easily foiled when someone near you has more information than you do. There are better ways to lead. Additionally if you had killed me at this point, you would have lost the only person that knows everything about your staff. I will call the meeting, but we should approach it with different intent." Vera'Cruz turned around and started walking away.
"How long does this last?" Chancellor Fulton was even more angry.
"It's nice to hear you asking questions for once. It'll last a couple of hours, so probably until sunset. Take some time and consider what I said. Depending on how you approach me next I will know if this government is worth saving."
"You started the coup?"
"No. But I may join it."
Chancellor Fulton seethed. Standing with the gun drawn, for three hours in his office. As the sun was setting behind him, he was finally released and sunk into the chair behind his desk. He muttered slowly to himself "Is information really the only weapon that will take me down? How do I control it?"
Then he paused he turned his chair out the window and looked at the city underneath him. "Maybe there is another way…" He pressed the intercom on his desk and his assistant's deep but familiar voice came over the line. "Yes Chancellor?" The response was very curt. "Get me every file, every piece of data, every living memory and knowledge about Adviser Vera'Cruz.
"Yes, sir."
