description: Allorien does a demo of the creation power of an axion for Dr. Palnov, King Romulus, Tim, and Jaedon.
note: An Axion (theoretical invisible particle/wave) is the foundation for all emotion, spirit energy, and when gathered together en masse forms the “dark matter” that holds the universe together. It is the foundation of all magic as it can be converted into other types of particles including the elusive and rare "anti-matter". An axion is the only particle that can be created to antimatter. The Crysix ride it for the faster than light starship drive they give humanity. It is generated by sentient species around the universe when they experience emotions and has different flavors based on that emotion; but is entirely invisible so it’s always one of the last discoveries and requires that species to trust things beyond what they can see.
