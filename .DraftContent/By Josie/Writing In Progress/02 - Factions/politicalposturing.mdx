Venus - Avalon
The king of Venus stood on the balcony looking down upon the representatives of his people. Small desks surrounded a podium and larger desks on one side of the room. The Semi-circle formation of senate chambers has served its purpose well during all human history. A voice was booming from the back of the floor. A 5'11” and very skinny man spring to his feet. “We know who they are, we should arrange for their release as well. I do not care what we must give them, the war will be over if we have all three of them. Get them here safely don't take risks.”
From the podium in front of the Senate Chambers came the response: “Senator Pace, we don't have the ability. Think about what we must give up just to get our princess back. ” Senator Le'Rue responded. He was a short round man of deep voice and frustrated tone. Senator Pace was interrupting his flow of leading the other Senators.
In May the Venusian government requested the release of three inmates from Terra Firma's super high security prison for political prisoners. After a month or so the leader of the Terra Firma Government, Chancellor Fulton, responded with two options. Those choices displayed on the board behind Senator Le'Rue.
“Let us start the vote.” Senator Le'Rue dictated. The room was large, but everyone could see the display. The entire wall behind the podium was a screen to project anything they needed at any given time. A panel flipped over on each senator's desk, including Le'Rue's. Each panel had three buttons one red, one blue and one green.
On the screen behind Le'Rue there were three options:
The red choice on the left, it was always there, “NO DEAL.” Details where underneath. Gwendolyn Romulus, Timothy Li, and Samuel Knudsen stay imprisoned by Terra Firma Government. Terra Firma state channels do not start broadcasting on our media. Venus will not surrender ownership of Mars to Terra Firma. Names started coming up on this choice with the planet they stand for most of which were Senators from Mars.
The blue choice in the middle said, “Partial Deal” Terra Firma frees Gwen Romulus and they take her to her father. Timothy Li and Samuel Knudsen stay imprisoned by Terra Firma Government. Terra Firma state channels will begin to broadcast on our media. Venus will not surrender ownership Mars to Terra Firma. As names started coming up they were mostly Senators from Venus. Le'Rue's name popped up there shortly after.
The green choice on the right said, “Full Deal” Terra Firma releases Gwen Romulus and returns her to her father. Terra Firma releases Timothy Li and Samuel Knudsen into custody of the Venusian military, and we give them the choice to return home. Terra Firma state channels will begin on our media and Venus will surrender ownership of Mars to Terra Firma. Senator Pace's name appeared along with the rest of the Senators from Pluto.
After a couple of minutes, the voting was slowing down and the numbers were stabilizing. It was clear that the partial deal was winning. The smirk on Le'Rue's face was one of contempt for anyone who could consider voting against him... He turned that smirk up to his king. The king felt a wave of disgust wash through him.
A few minutes later the vote was final. Le'Rue's gavel struck the table. He pronounced victory. “Thank you all. We will plan for the princess' release.”
Senator Pace glowered at Le'Rue from the back of the room, the king saw an ally.
Le'Rue stepped down from the podium and exited from one of the wing doors.
