April 16, 2559 C.E.
Eblypso - Kurrim Cross
Kurrim Cross was a city constructed of crystal and glass. People were walking on the sidewalks and they could look down into a subway system. The trains themselves were crystal. Walls and buildings were likewise completely transparent. Occupants could make them opaque but few members of the Crysix species did so, except when sleeping. The city shined with solar light transported though channels of crystal and glass from a city directly below the sun. However, they were about to become the center.
As the local star aligned to directly overhead, it shined directly on the main government building. It was the largest building in the Kurrim Cross. A large crystal was in the center of the building. There were channels of glass built into the floor. At every floor, 10 beams of light shined out of the building. The top floors shot off over the rest of the buildings of the city. Those beams of lightheaded to the crystals at the tops of other governmental centers in the middle of other cities.
At lower floors, they shined to smaller buildings who likewise had crystals built into their core. Those buildings distributed light to other buildings around the city. For two hours, this city controlled all the light on the planet, even the light that reached to the side where it was night.
Sitting in the conference room of the 23rd floor of the capitol building was Gildor Caigolor. He was leading this meeting. Caigolor was one of the largest Crysix ever born, standing at ten feet he was much less intimidating while sitting. He garbed himself in white robes with silver insignia. Above him a golden ring sparkled.
Gildor Caigolor was famous among Gelmir in the field of Universal Alignment as being the most stubborn and hardest to work with. The Crysix never needed to speak. Meetings at this table always occurred this way. The ring above his head shook as he spoke. His tone did not match his words, a soothing voice spoke, "I hate when people are late. Let us start. I'm going to file this as a report."
He took a small crystal ball off out of his pocked and placed it into a hole in the table. The ceiling turned slightly opaque and the room dimmed. A bright rainbow projected across the table. He clicked it 2 clicks to the left and the rainbow vanished. "Taurnil Ulaven deliver your report on the Clagees." Everyone turned to the person next to Caigolor.
Ulaven garbed themselves in the same way, in fact everyone around the table had the same outfit. However, they all had different emblems on their robes. Ulaven shifted forward slightly, the ring above his head turned slightly, and the ceiling above him became transparent to light up where he was sitting. "Yes, Elros." A quick glare from Caigolor was all it took. "My apologies, Gildor Caigolor, as you know the Clagees are the most promising of our child species. They have yet to travel outside of their home system of Epsilon Eridani, however, they have now noticed the Humans due to a burst of communication from Sol. It appears they are preparing to contact the humans."
Caigolor shifted slightly in his seat. "Okay, how quickly do you think that contact may happen?"
"No sooner than 10 years. They have no faster than light craft and their distanced communication methods take the same amount of time."
"Okay, Taurnil Ildilyntra." Caigolor turned toward the only empty seat at the table, "Right she's not here yet."
The door flung open and Ildilyntra was standing there. "I'm sorry I'm late." She was wearing the same white robes everyone else was. Her golden ring was shaking madly from anxiety and excitement. Everyone around the table knew something important happened.
Caigolor did not care what happened. "This meeting has been planned for three weeks. Do not come late again. Prepare a plan to exterminate humanity in nine years."
Hearing that, Ildilyntra's ring stopped at once. Terror struck. "What? Wait till you hear my report? What prompted this?" This drew a steely glare from Caigolor and surprise from around the table. Nobody had ever challenged Caigolor before.
Feeling the surprise from around the table anger welled up in Caigolor. "If you had been here on time you would have heard the report about how the Clagees were going to contact humanity in 10 years. Per our rules, the species that reaches out is the winner, and the other species dies. You consider the species you watch the best of our children. However, it is clear they are not."
Caigolor continued to speak about humanity, "They keep warring among themselves, they have divided themselves in a way that shows they will never be unified. They continue to create things that only bring pain to people and themselves. They cannot even figure out how to be productive without ruining their own home planets. There is nothing good about them."
She seethed on the other end of the table. Humanity was the best of the child species was she the only one that knew that? She could not think as the meeting went on. Half an hour later a violet circle appeared around the crystal in the middle. Ildilyntra continued to not listen. None of it was relevant to her....
"Ildilyntra, Taurnil Ildilyntra!" Caigolor's halo emanated a rose gold color. She was not listening but knew Caigolor was angry. Ildilyntra looked down at the table in surprise. Indigo and blue had already appeared. A green ring was beginning to fade in. She zoned out for fifteen minutes. She mentally chided herself for being so careless. Caigolor also chided her, "Ildilyntra pay attention. I know you hate the news that we will have to end humanity but that is no excuse for laziness. Please deliver your report on humanity."
"We have touched humanity's collective mind."
If the Crysix had jaws, they would be on the floor at this point. Mental silence filled the room for the first time since the meeting started. Caigolor recovered first. "Wait this isn't just a Mahtan giving them a new religion and claiming it will help them evolve, is it? That has happened so many times in the history of humanity and other species. It has never worked. They have just perverted whatever we gave them for their own desires."
"No, the species begins to look above themselves." The words Ildilyntra just said were code words written by the Crysix leaders before they started seeding solar systems in the hope of building a species to help them. Before now, the words have never had voice, only written. It is in this moment; it is for this reason that these meetings take place via mental speech. The dramatic effect of these words spoken for the first time in the history of a species many millennia old, impacted everyone around the table. They all knew, this was one of the most important moments in their species history.
"Okay, meeting adjourned, I need to deliver my report." Once Caigolor said that, a yellow ring, orange ring and red ring all faded onto the table at the same time to signify the meeting was over. This meeting concluded early, because of the weight of this news. Then he said the words he had been waiting to say since he started this role three hundred years ago. "Everyone, prepare for contact." Everyone around the table knew, that meant the species they were watching were about to end as failures.
