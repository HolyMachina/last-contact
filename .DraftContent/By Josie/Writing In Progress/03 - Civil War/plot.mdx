“They would kill us if they saw us together.” As Jamie's words came out of his mouth his breath was visible in the cold dark cavern. There was a drop of water followed by a quiet “Who? Your parents? Your father is a good friend of mine.” As this man stepped into the light he wore a battered business suit. “You know getting to you was not easy. You are after all the crowned prince of Mars.”
“It seemed like you had it easy enough getting me that book. You've been telling me a lot of things ever since. Why do you now stand before me?” Jamie glared at the slightly taller significantly older man. “You want me to betray my people.” Jamie drew a gun. “I refuse to do so.”
“No. That is not my intent.” Senator Pace raised his hands as if to say he surrendered. “I just want to find common ground between your government and mine.” Jamie raised his gun higher and rested his finger on the trigger. “How am I supposed to believe that?”
Another voice cut thought the quiet. “Jamie, I thought you better than this. We should at least hear him out.” Jamie's father stepped from behind a post in the cold, moldy, underground cavern. “That kind of thinking is what got us into this mess in the first place. It's because of thinking like that I cannot be with the woman I love. That is the thinking that drove us to hide our happiness. Should happiness ever be hidden?”
Jamie paused and lowered his gun. “Why do we have to not get along?” His eyes started tearing up slightly. “I'm sorry you and mom have to go though that because of small minded people. Why does it matter what sides of the solar system people came from? If they're in love, they should be allowed to be in love.”
Senator Pace spoke up next. “That is exactly my drive to fight. We will continue to be in touch but know this: I am going to start a war inside my own government we are going to overthrow the man in charge of the Venusian Government. His name is Senator Le'Rue and once we have everything we need to overthrow those that do not care about others, we will move.”
“What does this have to do with me?”
“We need you, You will be the way we win here on Mars. Many things depend on you and you don't know it yet. When things are moving, and it is time to act a man named Jaedon Beyar will approach you. Most likely he will come from the other side of the battlefield. In the meanwhile you are the crowed prince and you cannot do anything to jeopardize that.” As he said that the sound of boots in the cavern was becoming obvious. “You need to shoot me.” Senator Pace drew his gun pointing it at Jamie.
“What? No.” Jamie was caught off guard.
As the royal guard reached the group of three they started giving commands. “Halt! Drop your weapon! Who are you?” They already had their guns drawn.
Jamie's Father spoke up first “I am the prince's father and he is here. This person from the Venusian Government attempted to take us hostage thank you for saving us.”
“I am Senator Pace. I am here to do cause irreparable harm to your Government.” He looked at Jamie as if daring Jamie to shoot him. Jamie did finally draw his gun again. The guards didn't react fast enough but Jamie did. Senator Pace fired at Jamie's dad and he collapsed to the ground. Jamie shot back getting Senator Pace in the shoulder, but then a bright light and loud noise filled the room.
“Sir, are you okay?” on of the guards asked.
“Yes, track him. He can't get away.” Jamie was in on the game now. He knew his shot wasn't fatal but also knew it was a natural reaction for someone with firearm training. This is all going just as Senator Pace was planning. As the sound and light cleared he saw the guards chasing after Senator Pace, but there was no sign of him. His father was on the ground. Once the guards were out of earshot he said, “Dad, get up, we have to go.”
His father did not respond. Jamie rushed to his side but found that he was too late. Anger welled though out his body. He muttered under his breath, “Dad, was your death part of this plan? How could you?” His anger, sadness, and adrenaline gave him the strength needed to lift and carry his lifeless father out of the cold cavern. The cavern opened into a frozen tundra. There was a group of royal guards posted watch directly outside of the cavern and when they saw the prince they all saluted.
“Take him, he is wounded and most likely not survive. That scum killed him.” Jamie handed his father over to the medic of the squad and the medic shook his head sullenly. Jamie started walking away from the squad back toward the castle with his head hung deeply. ‘How do you expect me to side with you when you kill my father Senator Pace?' Jamie moved slowly into the ice castle he did not acknowledge the guards standing at the gate. He did not acknowledge the political dignitaries as he passed them in the hall.
The Queen of Mars came up to him. “Honey, I'm sorry about what happened. I heard about it. This is why we can't trust those people. We are lucky it was not you that he killed.” Jamie glowered at her mother his eyes seething with hate, yet also encircled with tears. “There is a reason it wasn't me. I have to go.” Jamie pushed the Queen away and continued his walk to his room.
When he got to his room, he made sure he was alone then took the brown leather book off the shelf and opened it to the first page, currently blank. He stared at it and then wrote: “Why?!”
