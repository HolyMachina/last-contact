Mahtan Allorien could feel it though the metal dome. They felt it over the hundreds of thousands of kilometers the wave traveled. They felt it though the walls of his spaceship. Allorien did not need their computer to feel it. It was conscious magic. It was magic done by choice. The species of humans Allorien watched has done a lot of work to ignore the word and manifestation of energy called magic.
Humanity tried to explain away with science anything that could not be known. To unravel the mysteries of the energy around them. Humans choose not to ask the real questions that would help them grow as a people. They knew once, but seemed to forget, that they could control forces of energy stronger than anything they created. They called it "magic" because they could not explain it. However, with the advances they made in science their advancement stalled. They could not progress any further using the scientific method. They only had one way left to advance, toward magic.
Allorien had been watching humanity since the year 2063. The earlier Mahtan, Pernelis, had died in 2096. The Crysix species deploys the Mahtan class of people to watch other species they have seeded around the galaxy. The Crysix understand humanity's eras as each Mahtan's time. Mahtan Pernelis' era which ranged from 1564 to 2096 was termed by the Crysix as "The Downfall of Humanity." Humans called it many things but it all started with what humans called "The Age of Reason."
Allorien was here to see. There were many times where they thought humanity would not continue to exist. Over the time Allorien watched humanity they have written reports that have included lines such as "I don't expect them to survive the next fifty years." and "This species is our greatest success." Allorien's supervisors had chided him after the conflicting messages he sent. They claimed Allorien's reports were impulsive and irrational. This was one of the largest insults imaginable for the Crysix species. In fact, his reporting was logical. The species of humanity was impulsive and irrational.
Allorien was roughly humanoid in shape and eight feet tall. His skin was extremely pale, sheet white and they wore long robes of the same color. His long silver hair and deep silver eyes supported a fully monochromatic appearance the only thing that contracted his unified appearance was a golden ring floating unsupported above his head.
His space craft was invisible from the outside. Tiny cameras built into each side of the ship made the other side of the ship appear as if the ship was not there. Allorien's ship had an armor plating that humanity could not detect with radar or any other means to their disposal yet.
Last time a child species detected them though radar the Crysix it caused a brief advance in Crysix technology. A species always created radar technology before they would contact the Crysix. Once the Crysix learned that they began to develop a stealth technology that they had hope would last until magic was a science. That child species found the Crysix too soon and looked to the Crysix as an enemy. The Crysix exterminated them as a failure.
Allorien sent a quick note to his supervisor, they did not move physically the text displayed on the screen regardless:
"Findecáno Sadrill,
"I have found the strongest source of conscious energy manipulation yet recorded by humanity. The spike of anxiety released in a split second was beyond the charting systems in my ship. A Human is starting to use energy flow, not chemical medicine, to manage emotions. I intend to track this subject as closely as possible. I will inform my compatriots.
"Mahtan Allorien."
Allorien's golden ring vibrated slightly and the ship came out of a static orbit around Saturn. They cleared the satellite orbit which held them for over twenty years and sighed deeply. ‘Finally, we're making some progress.' Allorien watched the gas giant planets for any progress, it was his mission. There were three other Mahtan in the solar system watching humanity, but Allorien thought they were onto something strong enough to follow it personally.
