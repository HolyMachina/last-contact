# The Pact

## July 30, 2295

### Eblypso

#### Kurrim Cross City

##### Main Street

Allorien and Tim walked amongst Allorien's home of crystal and glass. Tim took in everything he could. "This place is amazing." There were all kinds of Crysix walking up and down the street. Many of them had different halo colors of all kinds. The whole rainbow was present, except blue. Tim was garnered a lot of attention.

A semi-loud rumbling grabbed Tim's attention and he looked down through the glass sidewalk as a crystalline train rumbled past below. "You can even see the subways!" The light flickered off the building into Tim's eye and he winced.

_It's not that special,_ Allorien responded.

_It's so amazing!_ Tim thought back.

_Oh, you're getting better at that!_

_I'm trying. It's so unnatural to communicate telepathically._

Walking down the street there were Crysix of all shapes and sizes with halos of different colors. A tall muscular red haloed member of the species walked past them the other direction in the street. The red halo Crysix stared at him for much too long as they walked by.

_What's red mean?_ Tim paused, getting fully distracted by the situation.

_Oh, they're the enforcers, they're equivalent to our police force._ Allorien motioned for Tim to keep walking.

"Why are they staring so much?" Tim started walking again beside Allorien

_You're different. They always get curious when someone else of another species is here._

_Does that happen often?_

As they stepped walked down the street buildings past them by and each time Tim winced from the light reflecting out of the crystalline channels that passed though the buildings passing light throughout the buildings. _Oh shoot, sorry._ Allorien though and handed him a pair of polarized tinted glasses. _I forgot people who aren't Crysix can't handle the light here_

Tim accepted them and put them on, "Oh, that's so much better." He looked around again and reassessed his surroundings without being harmed by the quantity of light coming off of the crystalline buildings. _Why are there no other blue halos here?_

_We call them connectors. They keep us connected to the world around us and each other. Think of them as the way we interface with the energies around us. It's the connector that kept me hidden from your species for so long. It also is how we determine our role in our society and other various things that keep us connected with our own people._

_You didn't answer my question. Why no other blue ones?_

_Oh sorry._ Allorien paused to hold a door open for Tim. Tim stepped into the largest building on the street. _It's because the blue ones, like mine, are for those destined to watch, mentor, and connect, with other species that we helped bring into the universe. Most of the people with blue halos do not spend much time on this world._

##### Building 12

There were plenty of Crysix people coming and going from the building. Allorien walked confidently to the front desk. Tim tried to mirror that aura, but didn't do as well. The front desk was staffed with two Crysix entities with red halos. As they walked up he motioned to Tim. The security officer nodded and handed Allorien a green pulsing connector which Allorien balanced above Tim's head and spun like a top. _Don't move your head too much._ It hovered above Tim's head and moved to stay in place despite Tim trying to look at it.

"Excuse me?"

_The less you move your head the less likely it is to fall off. Think of it like your visitor's pass._

Allorien started to walk off. Tim quickly gathered his thoughts and followed him, _visitor's pass? This is all too crazy. Explain it for real._

_You're here to make your case for why humanity shouldn't die._

"Wait! What? We only met a couple years ago." Tim turned to Allorien with an incredulous scowl.

_It's been 10 years. And humanity is on trial._ Allorien looked back at Tim with compassion, empathy, and sadness. _You being here will make a much higher chance your species is saved._

_Saved from what?_

_Our Brutality._ A soft chime occurred and a door opened in front of them. Allorien motioned Tim into the circular crystalline tube. Tim stood there.

"Wait, what? Should I get in?"

_It's your only option._

Tim stepped in, _that doesn't make me feel comfortable._

_Good, you wouldn't be a good leader if you were comfortable with that._

Both of them stepped in together. Microseconds they were in the elevator the door closed and streaked upward. Tim was not ready but he did not lose his balance. "How is everything here so responsive."

_There's a particle in the universe that you called the axion. There were many times that humanity came close to discovering it's true properties. We use it as a limitless renewable source of energy. It also reads, and therefore can react to, the emotions of sentient beings._ Almost as if timed, when Allorien finished his explanation the door opened in front of them.

They were injected directly into a large glass room with a judge, jury, and Fae at a table to the right. "This looks like a court room." _It is._ Responded the judge telepathically. _Please, take your seat._ The judge motioned to an empty table on the left side of the room with two chairs. _I see he doesn't speak like us._ The judge projected to everyone in the room as Allorien and Tim both sat at the table.

_I do. It's just not natural to me yet._ Everyone looked at Tim as he responded.

_So you know how to use the particles._ The judge responded. Tim looked over to Allorien, who spoke next. _I, formally, on behalf of the species of humanity, ask for a pact._ Tim looked at them with a bit of suprise.

_Your request is acknoledged._ Allorien you will defend humanity in this trial. Fae you will represent the opposition to a pact. 

They both said back _Yes._

The judge banged a gavel. _Let this pact making begin._

_What's going on?_ Tim thought directly to Allorien who directly responded _Like I said, You're saving humanity._

The judge continued. _Ten years ago we, in this courtroom, we reviewed the course of humanity. Our intial judgement was that humanity was failed as a species and would be wiped out. Allorien presented new evidence after the fact, and we suspended the case for ten years. What progress has been made in that ten years?_

Allorien stepped out from behind the desk. _We have developed a strong relationship with people in humanity. While we still only have direct contact with one humanity he has the ability, as you've seen, to use the particle despite not fully understanding it._ Allorien motioned to Tim, _There are many others who can use the particle, but cannot control it enough to contact myself or Fae._

Fae stepped forward. _Exactly. Humanity is a race of millions of individuals. We have had contact with one sigle individual. This is not a sign of humanity's growth it establishes an anonoly. We cannot possibly make policy based on an anonomoly. I motion that we remove the suspension and continue with the eliminiation of humanity._

Tim gasped loudly and stepped forward yelling, "You cannot possibly be proposing the mass extinction of a species?! That's absoutly uncalled for. What kind of trial is this?"

The judge gaveled very loudly saying _Order. Order in the room._ The room got quiet there was a long pause and the judge turned to Allorien _One more outburst like that and I will summarily judge against you. Human, sit._

_Yes, your honor. Proceeding my case: Yes this human, his name is Tim, and yes Fae, he represents an anonomly. An anonomly we've never seen before. Usually when we see a speices that can use the particle they either do not seek to explain it or they distribute the knoledge broadly enough that the knoledge is known en mass._

Fae spoke up again. _But did Tim seek to explain the magical powers? No. How he even knows about the partile now is confusing._

Tim again spoke. _I did not know about the particle until mintues ago, and Fae is correct, I did not seek to explain the powers I had beyond their existance. Allorien shared the fact with me in the elevator coming up here._

Everyone looked at Allorien. And the judge spoke up while the 12 member jury took copious notes _In that case your preliminary brief leading into this
