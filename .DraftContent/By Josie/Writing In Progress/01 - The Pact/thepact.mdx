# The Pact

## July 30, 2295

### Eblypso

#### Kurrim Cross City

##### Main Street

Allorien and Tim walked amongst Allorien's home of crystal and glass. Tim took in everything he could. "This place is amazing." There were all kinds of Crysix walking up and down the street. Many of them had different halo colors of all kinds. The whole rainbow was present, except blue. Tim was garnered a lot of attention.

A semi-loud rumbling grabbed Tim's attention and he looked down through the glass sidewalk as a crystalline train rumbled past below. "You can even see the subways!" The light flickered off the building into Tim's eye and he winced.

_It's not that special,_ Allorien responded.

_It's so amazing!_ Tim thought back.

_Oh, you're getting better at that!_

_I'm trying. It's so unnatural to communicate telepathically._

Walking down the street there were Crysix of all shapes and sizes with halos of different colors. A tall muscular red haloed member of the species walked past them the other direction in the street. The red halo Crysix stared at him for much too long as they walked by.

_What's red mean?_ Tim paused, getting fully distracted by the situation.

_Oh, they're the enforcers, they're equivalent to our police force._ Allorien motioned for Tim to keep walking.

"Why are they staring so much?" Tim started walking again beside Allorien

_You're different. They always get curious when someone else of another species is here._

_Does that happen often?_

As they stepped walked down the street buildings past them by and each time Tim winced from the light reflecting out of the crystalline channels that passed though the buildings passing light throughout the buildings. _Oh shoot, sorry._ Allorien though and handed him a pair of polarized tinted glasses. _I forgot people who aren't Crysix can't handle the light here_

Tim accepted them and put them on, "Oh, that's so much better." He looked around again and reassessed his surroundings without being harmed by the quantity of light coming off of the crystalline buildings. _Why are there no other blue halos here?_

_We call them connectors. They keep us connected to the world around us and each other. Think of them as the way we interface with the energies around us. It's the connector that kept me hidden from your species for so long. It also is how we determine our role in our society and other various things that keep us connected with our own people._

_You didn't answer my question. Why no other blue ones?_

_Oh sorry._ Allorien paused to hold a door open for Tim. Tim stepped into the largest building on the street. _It's because the blue ones, like mine, are for those destined to watch, mentor, and connect, with other species that we helped bring into the universe. Most of the people with blue halos do not spend much time on this world._

##### Building 12

There were plenty of people coming and going from the building. Allorien walked confidently to the front desk. Tim tried to mirror that aura, but didn't do as well. The front desk was staffed with two Crysix entities with red halos. As they walked up he motioned to Tim. The security officer nodded and handed Allorien a green pulsing connector which Allorien balanced above Tim's head and spun like a top. _Don't move your head too much._ It hovered above Tim's head and moved to stay in place despite Tim trying to look at it.

"Excuse me?"

_The less you move your head the less likely it is to fall off. Think of it like your visitor's pass._

Allorien started to walk off. Tim quickly gathered his thoughts and followed him, _visitor's pass? This is all too crazy. Explain it for real._

_You're here to make your case for why humanity shouldn't die._

"Wait! What? We only met a couple years ago." Tim turned to Allorien with an incredulous scowl.

_It's been 10 years. And humanity is on trial._ Allorien looked back at Tim with compassion, empathy, and sadness. _You being here will make a much higher chance your species is saved._

_Saved from what?_

_Our Brutality._ A soft chime occurred and a door opened in front of them. Allorien motioned Tim into the circular tube. Tim stood there.

"Wait, what? Should I get in?"

_It's your only option._

Tim stepped in, _that doesn't make me feel comfortable._

_Good, you wouldn't be a good leader if you were comfortable with that._
