Mars - Dorsa Argentea
Separated from the war on the equator the south pole of Mars hosted an icy castle. Austral Citadel was covered in carbon dioxide ice. While the castle's skirt of ice came and went with the seasons, the castle was always there. The interior of the structure of the castle was steel and concrete. Inside the castle was warm and inviting. The outer shell was only a facade designed for intimidation. It was successful. The castle got very few visitors despite the fact that the residents were the monarchs of Mars' southern half.
The bedroom was austere and gilded in gold. The value of it was not appreciated by the primary resident. The young prince had long dirty blond hair and spotless pajamas. It was time for him to go to bed. His mother, the queen, and his father, who was not a king, sat with him on the extremely large four post bed.
He looked at his golden-haired mother, with love but also maturity. On Mars children grew up too quickly. He was only a child, but he knew he would be king during a war. His mother was queen during a war; his grandfather and great grandfather were also kings during wartime. Most people believed he would continue the war. At ten, he thought everyone should get along. Nobody saw the hidden maturity in his eyes. Most of the time his concerns were written off as wishful thinking. He turned toward his dark haired father, “Why do we have to fight dad?”
“Jamie, Mars is a place where our way of living and another, different way of living exist together. Every time those two ways have existed side by side, fighting has occurred.”
“They aren't that different from us, why should we keep fighting?”
“Now son,” His mother spoke up at this point, “We don't really have a choice. We are a colony of Terra Firma. We must follow the directions of Chancellor Fulton.” Jamie shivered. His parents decided that was the best time to leave him to bed. They both got up, kissed him on the forehead and went toward the door. As she reached the door, Jamie questioned Queen Hedlund. “Have we even spoken with the other side?”
She glanced back but didn't turn all the way around, “No, we would quickly lose our power if we did so.” She and her partner quickly walked the rest of the way to the door and clicked off the crystal chandelier. Just before leaving and closing the door she said, “We would be freezing out on the streets.”
Jamie considered this and decided that maybe it is best just to follow orders.


September 16, 2550 C.E.
Mars - Dorsa Argentea
The room was dark and cold. It was not cold because the building was coated in ice; he just liked it that way. One wall was a series of screens that had on many television programs at once. He chose which one had sound at any give time. As a prince it was his job to study the political narratives and power players in the solar system. However, this particular news item struck him as odd. He read the headline again. “Dr. Palnov brutally murdered by Venusian Special Forces.” He changed the sound over to that program.
“—Was one of the first graduates of The Columbia University school of Religious Science…” This was the only organization carrying this particular news item. Jamie knew, when only one news outlet carried a story it was usually a path to a hidden truth. This particular news story was only on Terra Firma's official news channel. No other independent or Venusian news channel was carrying it. He pulled out a binder and took notes on the story.
“Fredrick Palnov was responsible for many breakthroughs in science and religion. He was found murdered in his laboratory on September 4th,” The news story continued. Jamie wrote into the notebook the fact that the news story was twelve days late. “He single handedly proved that science and religion can go hand. He wrote many essays and books on the topic. Well respected in all scientific and religious circles he worked directly for our glorious chancellor Fulton and was personal friends with the archbishop of the Unified Christian Church. He was orphaned at a young age when his parents where killed in a terrorist bombing in London also arranged by Venusian Special Forces Military. The Chancellor has promised swift military action against the parties responsible.”
Jamie rolled his eyes. He knew that meant another battle will happen on Mars. There is already nothing but war on Mars. Terra Firma can't attack Venus right now, so they just take it out on Mars. Just then the door opened and his father walked in. Jamie quickly muted the TV as his father came to sit by him. “Jamie, there's something I have to tell you.”
The, now 19 year old, turned to his father with concern. “What's that dad?”
The middle aged man shifted uncomfortably. “You know that I am your father and will always love you. As well you know that I am not allowed to marry your mother.”
“Not allowed to?” Jamie had never heard him use this phrasing before.
“Yes, The Chancellor will not allow us to marry. It was his condition for allowing me to stay alive. Your mother bargained for my life.” He could see his son was shocked.
“Why? Why would she have to do that? Who is this Chancellor?” The prince was astounded the leader of his government would force someone to bargain for the life of someone they love.
“You will find out who he is in time. What is important for you to know now is my past.” Serim Aktug swallowed deeply. “Before I fell in love with your mother I was a member of an elite team in the Venusian Military. I grew up on the other side of Mars. I was recruited by their military because I was sick of constant fighting and I vowed to put an end to it. I became a corporal and had many skills which I hated. I was in line for the biggest job, it would end the war and bring peace. At least I thought so. My assignment was to assassinate your mother.”
Jamie gasped, and jumped off of the plush couch. Jamie put his fists up to his father ready to punch him.
“Whoa, I didn't do it did I?” his father found himself bargaining again, this time to keep his son's anger at bay.
Jamie put his fists down, but wasn't convinced. “You're still the enemy.” Somehow hearing this news made the room feel even colder.
Serim sighed, “That is the kind of thinking that created a rule that I cannot marry the woman I love. When your mother and I fell in love I told my superiors and she told the Chancellor. My superiors demanded I continue with my mission. The Chancellor wanted me dead, and he didn't even know who I really was, just that I was from the north. Please, son, sit.”
Jamie begrudgingly relaxed a little bit and sat back down with his father as he continued the story that happened before his own life.
“Your mother and I tried to build a bridge between worlds. We tried to unite Mars. Both the Venusian Government and the Terra Firma Government strongly opposed the union, and our love. It wasn't long until we found out she was pregnant. Both sides wanted to use you, use us, as their pawn to win the war and declare victory. That's when we learned, nobody cares about Mars and its people. The whole planet is a bargaining chip. A card to be played. We refused to accept that.” Serim's dedication was clear in his voice.
“When you were born the Terra Firma government was nice enough to give me a new identity so that I could be your father and help you grow. I promised never to tell you all this information. My real name is Serim Aktug. If anyone can continue our dream of building a bridge between the cultures it is you. I don't even know if you believe me.” He reached out to hug his son. Jamie hugged back.
