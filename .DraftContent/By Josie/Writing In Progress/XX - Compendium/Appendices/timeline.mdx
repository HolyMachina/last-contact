Timeline
November 2004 C.E.: President Bush (R) Re-elected
2006: IAU (International Astronomical Union) officially defines what a ‘planet' is and Pluto is reclassified as a dwarf planet, and taken out of the official lists of planets for the solar system.
2004 – 2008: C.E.: U.S. Population becomes angry about the Economic circumstances in the United States, demand change. Blame Republicans for overspending and getting us into two needless wars. The wars become a major toll on Pres. Bush's Job Approval.
November 2008 C.E.: President Obama (D) Elected, the first African-American male to hold the position becomes President of the United States
January 2009 C.E.: Barack Obama inaugurated as President and immediately begins on his agenda, starts pushing forth policies from the far left, empowered by the "Super Majority" of democrats in other branches of the US government. He also started removing troops from the War on Terrorism claiming that we are winning it.
February - October 2009 C.E.: President Obama becomes unpopular over a healthcare bill that vastly expands the size of the U.S. Federal Government. Also dragging his poll numbers down is the continued issues with the sluggish U.S. Economy and High Unemployment.
November 2009 C.E.: A wave of "vacancy filling" elections occurs in the United States, they are irrelevant to the "national" makeup of the government. The strongly republican leaning results show a country divided evenly between the two parties. Democrats continue their strategy of governing from the left.
January 19, 2010 C.E.: In a special election to replace a long sitting democrat senator, a republican wins a senate seat that just a few years ago was safely in the left's camp. Causing a major balance shift overnight.
November 2010 C.E.: Republicans gain control of the House of Representatives. They run on a platform of economic conservatism, and it causes a shift of national political affiliation inside the United States. The Congress of the United States has a party in control of each branch. This instills a two party system again in the United States and very little will be done for the next two years.
January 2011 – October 2012 C.E.: With the new republicans in the house both parties need to come to agreements. Very little is agreed upon, and the only legislation that gets through the government at all, are the non-controversial, non-relevant ones. However, the majority of the U.S. population becomes more content and the economy starts picking up again.
November 2012 C.E.: Republicans and Democrats both run on the same positions as the midterm elections in 2010. Most incumbents win reelection and there is very little change in the balance of power. President Obama also wins reelection. Shortly after his reelection, President Obama declares that we have won the war on terror.
December 2012 – January 2015 C.E.: During this time very little changed politically in the United States or the United Nations. There was change in various other countries but it became irrelevant worldwide because of the stances of the United States or United Nations. A Muslim extremist group also comes to power in the Middle East named ISIS,it separated out from a recently defeated group of the same intent named Al'Quida, and threatens to shake an unstable international set of governments to its knees. The United States and United Nations take little to no action on this issue, even though most of the rest of the world wants to.
June 16, 2015 C.E.: The supreme court of the United States, taking power away from the legislators in congress that represented the people ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that state level bans of gay marriage are unconstitutional and it stood that Gay Marriage became legal across the United States.
August 2015 – May 2016: This was the most aggressive set of political campaigns ever recorded in the United States. It was a series of primaries to decide who would run for President in 2016. President Obama could not run again and a he beginning there were no real strong Democrat names other than Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders became her strongest competitor; however, he was not able to gain enough votes to prevent her from wining the primary. The internal race between Democrats was very rough. A similar thing happened to Republicans. There were no strong names for Republicans either. A massively rich land owner named Donald Trump became the Republican Candidate. It was difficult of either party to gain support of the middle, because of how insane both major party candidate sounded speaking only from their far party line. This set of primaries would determine the course of Human Politics for  hundreds of years to come, but nobody knew it at the time.
June 2016 – November 2016: The presidential race was equally disturbing. Many videos and emails came from the past to haunt both candidates. Clinton was embroiled in a scandal regarding her saving classified emails to a private email server. Trump was embroiled in scandals in multiple situations of him saying something misogynistic, racist, sexist or otherwise extremely rude.
Tuesday, November 8, 2016 C.E: in one of the closest presidential general elections of all time, driven by a hatred of misogyny, and a hatred of political pandering and career politicians Donald Trump (R) narrowly beats Hillary Clinton (D) to become the next U.S President. On the same day Republicans are elected to take control at all levels of U.S. Government. The Canadian immigration website crashes from too many U.S. Citizens were looking to immigrate to Canada.
June 2017 C.E.: War on Terrorism reinstated as a full out war on ISIS and renamed World War III by President Donald Trump. Other countries sign on, as a war to remove all Terrorism in the world. Republican approval ratings climb after the government finds a way to mute the outcry of people that are opposed to all wars regardless of their point or goal. This causes the effect of minimizing the United States' far left parties. Which causes the Republican party to be the only surviving political power in the United States.
July 2017 C.E. – November 2025 C.E.: US Liberal Migration: Most liberals in The United States, angry with how the United States minimized the far left in the country move to Canada and Europe, and start to take further control of all levels of government in Canada, the European Union and its member nations. They begin to minimize Conservatism in Europe but do not succeed in doing so in Canada, Liberals in Canada also move to Europe
Tuesday, June 16, 2026 C.E.: Exactly 11 years after Obergefell v. Hodges was ruled on by the Supreme Court. The United States passed Amendment XXXVI to the United States Constitution which reversed the ruling and made all families other than that hetero-normative family illegal, and re-restricted gender expression to two binaries determined by biological sex required. This reversed all work of the LGBT movement in the United States for roughly 56 years. As there were no socially liberal minded people remaining in the United States to oppose this action, this action passed without much trouble.
December 2026 C.E. – February 2035 C.E.: Global Conservative Migration: Conservatives in Europe become frustrated living under Liberal governments and being minimized move toward North America, and form the North American Empire: A union between the countries of the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

The North American Empire and the European Union join the fight on two different sides of the war. World War IV begins.
October 2053 C.E.: Asian Nations fearing for their own future unite into the Asian Alliance. They do not immediately involve themselves in the war, merely trying to first set aside their many historical differences and finally unite as one people.
January 2062 C.E.: The North American Empire and the European Union conquer the Middle East. The two sides divide the Middle East as they see fit and each control half putting up a massive physical barrier between the two halves.

The North American empire, now spanning the entirety of the Americas is renamed The American Empire. The European union does nothing to respond as they do not consider it their problem.
November 28th 2063 C.E.: Mahtan Allorien comes of age and is assigned to watch over Earth and humans. He is given briefing regarding the history of the humans and the course of their lives but is reminded his job is only to watch until he is found. He is disgusted by the humans and the illogical ways in which they have acted. He begins duty and sits in orbit around earth like the predecessor he relieved.
September 2064 – July 2070 C.E: The Asian Alliance collapses and war begins within, The American Empire comes to pick up the pieces of failed governments and war torn lands, uniting all the former Asian Alliance states under the "Pan-Pacific Empire" banner.

August 2075 – June 2093 C.E: The Pan-Pacific Empire continues declares World War 5, by moving against The European Union taking it over slowly, a single member nation at a time, beginning in the middle east. World War 5 would be the last "War to end all Wars" in Earth's History. All political prisoners during this time are taken to the Moon and are expected to live the rest of their life there. If those prisoners have children, they are also expected to live their lives there.
July 2093 C.E.: WWV Ends with a treaty where The Pan-Pacific Empire controls the entirety of humanity. A new government would be establish to assert unified control and laws over the planet.
December 2094 C.E.: The Pan-Pacific Empire is renamed The Terra Firma Empire. Earth is renamed ‘Terra Firma' President of America declared Terra Firma Chancellor the supreme executive of the government. His first action is to find and imprecision all liberals so they did not subvert his government.

November 2172 C.E.: Venusian government goes to settle on the Minor Planet Pluto and reclassifies it as a regular planet again overruling the IAU ruling of 2006 declaring it a dwarf planet.
