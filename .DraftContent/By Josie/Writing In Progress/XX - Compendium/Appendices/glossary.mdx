Glossary
CO2: Carbon Dioxide
Crysix: The Crysix are a species of aliens, they look much like humans believe angels to look. They are very fair skinned and have halos. They put the genetics on Earth to start evolution. They also influenced the writing of the Bible.
H2SO4: Sulfuric Acid
Ithaca Chasma: Ithaca Chasma is a 65 kilometer (40 mile) wide valley that may have formed when a watery mantle froze, splitting Tethys to compensate for the extra bulk.
Mars: Mars is called the red planet. It is a planet covered by red dust. It has been settled by both Terra Firma and Venus. There is severe combat in orbit. All housing is underground in Mars' thick crust. Its gravity is only 38% that of Terra Firma. It is also significantly smaller.
Perepelkin: Perepelkin is a crater on the Western Hemisphere of Mars. It is just south-west of 60 North 60 West.
Pluto: Pluto was the 9th planet of the Sol System before it lost its planetary status in 2005. It regained that status shortly thereafter. It is a pile of rock that was colonized by Venus after the attack that demonstrated that Venus may not be safe. They sent people to flee to the farthest planet.
Sirius A: Sirius A is the star where the Crysix began. It is a blue-white star about 1.7 times the size of Sol. It burns about 18,000˚F (10,000˚C). It is 8.55 Light years away from Terra Firma.
Sol: The Sun, it is 1,392,000km (85,000 miles) in diameter. It burns a Yellow color at 9,900˚F (5,500˚C). This star is the star where the human species began.
Terra Firma: This is the name given to Earth after the American Empire took over. It was designed to sound forbidding and make the population of the planet fear the government.
Telemachus: Telemachus is a crater on Tethys. It is near 30 East 60 North. It is the home to Terra Firma's Prison. Its exit is into the Ithaca Chasma.
Tethys: Tethys is the 5th largest moon of Saturn. It is home to a prison. This is the prison Terra Firma created to house liberals arrested on Terra Firma. The inmate's minds are wiped of any memories, and they do not know it is a prison.
Thought Drive: This is a drive system created by the Crysix. It is a drive for interstellar travel that is powered by conscious magic, powered by the thoughts of the pilot. It is mainly used for light years of distances. However, it can also be used for very quick travel between near distances.
Venus: Venus is the 2nd planet in the Sol System. It was the hottest planet until the atmosphere was thinned by liberal settlers. It is the closest planet to Terra Firma in the Sol System. It was difficult to tame because of its many volcanic features, but humans eventually found a way to cool the planet, bringing it to a life supporting balance. Its gravity is 92% of that of Terra Firma.
Wakizashi: The Wakizashi is a medium length sword, shaped much like a Katana from Japan. They can be used to dual wield.
