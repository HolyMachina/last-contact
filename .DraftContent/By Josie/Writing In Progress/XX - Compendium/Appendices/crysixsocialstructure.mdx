Crysix Social Structure

About the Hierarchy: If a class has a different singular form, it will be in parenthesis after the plural form for that class.
Ereinion (Círdan): The Ereinion are the highest ranking people in the Crysix in the species. They are all revered as Gods/Goddesses. They control the species with an Iron Fist. If a problem gets all the way up to the royalty someone usually gets punished. They have engineered the Crysix to control themselves. They are basically watchers and mostly benevolent rulers.
Indis Andratta: The Royal Couple are nothing short of a God and Goddess to this species. They control all of the Crysix. They go to the Gildor for their view of the universe. Through those eyes they see all. They are worshiped as a God and Goddess. They are never questioned. They slightly fear the Amrod, because they fear being watched without their knowledge.
Galdor (Fingon): The Galdor are demigods. They attend the throne of The Royal Couple. They are the only people with a complete understanding of the Royal Couple. They are somewhat like lieutenants. The Royal Couple will assign a Galdor to each major department of their species. All Fights within the Amroth are solved by the Galdor.
Gildor (Gelmir): Gildor report to the Galdor and The Royal Couple about what’s going on in the universe. They have two forms. One form is a connection to the psychic world; the other form is a connection to the physical world. They have the same memory in both forms, but they cannot interact with the opposite world. Therefore, a Gildor needs to be in the same form as another Gildor to interact with them. They need to be in physical form to interact with any other physical being in the universe.
Elros (Elendil): The Gildor’s physical form, they have a body that looks mostly normal (for a Crysix). This is the only form visible. They can use their mouth and eyes. This is their form connected with the PHYSICAL world. They have no connection with the spiritual/magical/psychic world in this form.
Amrod (Amras): The psychic from of a Gildor, they are invisible to everything except psychic powers. They frequently use this form to pass secret messages from Amrod to Amrod. They are very secretive when in this form. These are the only class of people in the Crysix species The Royal Couple fear slightly.
Amroth: The Crysix Amroth are excellent administrators. Their job is control. The Orodreth and Taurnil report directly to the Galdor. Their job is to make sure everything is running smoothly on a day to day basis.
Orodreth (Mablung): All fights within the Glorfindel come directly to the Orodreth. They are revered as the judges. They are extremely humble and wise. They have far more wisdom then intelligence, which make them perfect judges. They will expect that what they say should be done gets done. It’s a trust in the right place; everyone in this species listens to their superiors.
Taurnil (Elessar): These people are the leaders of Glorfindel. They give orders down to the Glorfindel. They control who does what and when in the big picture. This group makes the plans created by the Silinde and Silinda happen. They are administrators. No more, no less. They are lost without people below them, they are lost trying to make plans, they frequently feel lost, and give orders to fill that void.
Silinde (Golradir): This group of the Crysix Amroth, in part, makes the plans the Taurnil use. They spend a lot of time in conference with Silinda. Silinde know what needs to change, what polices need to be adapted. They are intellectuals, do a lot of research about thoughts. When they aren’t planning changes for the Crysix they are in libraries reading. They however are horrid with logistics. Changes in the species always start here, it doesn’t matter if it’s a policy or procedure change.
Silinda (Eö): The Silinda do all the logistical planning for the Silinde’s plans. If it is not a feasible plan they will discuss the plan over with the Silinde until it is feasible. Once they have agreed on a plan they bring it to the Taurnil together. Where the Silinde are the thinkers and idealists, the Silinda are the rational side, they see if the plans can actually work. They are incredibly skilled with scheduling and timing events and changes.
Glorfindel: The Crysix Glorfindel are all the workers of the species. They do the various things the Ereinion and Amroth have been planning.
Valandil (Huor): The Valandil serve only a bureaucratic purpose. They are nothing but paper pushers. They are the connection between the Taurnil and the Findecáno. They are very frequently skipped however, and they have been less and less useful in recent years. Most of the Ereinion expects them to be gone soon, and every Huor will be found a place in a different caste, most of them will be moving down to become Findecáno.
Findecáno: These are the low level managers; they run from planet to planet, solar system to solar system, keeping an eye on their charges. They are direct supervisors of all those below of them they are supposed to report to the Valandil but lately they have been bypassing the Valandil and speaking directly to the Taurnil especially about emergencies.
Fingolfin: The Fingolfin are all the people who do things in the Crysix. Some may be moving to different planets and solar systems, some are just the same thing as police officers, some are low level managers. This is the broadest category in the caste system of the Crysix. They are not ranked but they are all equals. And they are all given orders from Findecáno. There should be no conflict between them if the Findecáno are consistent.
(As of yet unknown)
Mahtan: The Mahtan serve a very specific purpose. They watch. The Crysix have spawned many species throughout the years. A Mahtan is assigned to each species to watch them for the Mahtan’s life span. It is the most boring job in the Crysix, but it is by far the most rewarding, because you get to see first had the purpose of the whole species. They report to the Findecáno and are always instructed not to get involved with their charges. No child species of the Crysix has ever made contact.
Taurnalê: The Taurnalê are the police of the Crysix species. They are very good at every defensive magic known to the galaxy. They are very frequently called in to protect higher ranking Crysix. They are used only by order of the Taurnil. They have the longest life spans of the Crysix save The Royal Couple. They are not very good at fighting on the front lines of war, they do not have the blood lust, and in fact the Crysix as a species does not. They are protectors. They do that job better than anyone else in the Galaxy.
Erora: The Erora are the defenders of the Crysix species universe wide. They defend all interests of their species with fervor. They are very skilled in defensive magic and magic that can damage physical forms and beings. Erora are never brought in to defend against their own species. They are solely employed in defending the species against external threats. They have very short life spans compared to other Crysix their lifespan is more similar to a human. They are the most emotional sect of the Crysix species. They also reproduce faster than any other sect.
