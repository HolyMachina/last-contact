Terra Firma - New York City

"A History of Light" was the law of the land. The 26th Century Bible was in shatters. The Unified Christian Church was falling apart. His life's work was falling apart. He had come to work over the last couple of months increasingly despondent. He needed a change, but this is all he has ever known. Once the Terra Firma Government turned their back on him, he had nothing left.

He sat there in the science lab and took the last copy of his study that he had. All the others his supervisor destroyed. "The world will never know that we are all part of a web together." He began to light it on fire.

A tall woman rushed in and snuffed out the fire. Her skirt fluttered around her in her haste "No, we need that, and I need you, come on." She grabbed him by the arm and ignored his protests. "This will be the last thing you have no choice on." He stared at her.

"My name is Ylena. I am taking you to a place where you will have freedom to publish that document. Come with me and be casual."

"Wait what?" Confusion gripped his mind, he was unable to process what was happening to him.

"Why can nobody just accept things in this Universe?" She pointed to the banner above his door. "See that I am taking you away from here, to a better place, accept it and come with me, casually."

The scientist shrugged and muttered "anything is better than here."
