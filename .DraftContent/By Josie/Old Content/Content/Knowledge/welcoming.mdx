March 4, 2559 C.E.
Tethys to Mars - Edith
All four of them stood around Edith’s projected map. They were in open space. Their ship was in the center of the map. There was nothing around them except a second ship was directly behind them. Jaedon turned to Tim. “I presume he has been tailing us for a while since he has not opened fire in any way. Which means he could have kept himself hidden and just watch us. Why did he show himself?”
“I asked him to.” Everyone stared at Tim. “Yes, we spoke. I have trouble believing it myself.”
Both ships floated there in a moment of hesitation. The alien ship was small and looked like a needle standing up on itself. “I’m glad I updated Edith’s sensors package.” Jaedon muttered. The sensor ping was minuscule. “Edith, open up a communications channel.” A few moments later a click happened and there was a rustling sound of paper on the other end.
“Did I get it? Does it work? Can you hear me? I’ve never used this before.” The voice was slightly high pitched.
It was Jaedon’s ship, so he spoke. “Yes, we can hear you.”
“We?” The voice though the communication system felt surprised.
“Yes, there are four of us here. Who are you and are you the only person there?”
“I am alone, yes. It is what humanity would perceive as the least threatening. I have watched your race four, no, five hundred and two years. You are the people who may be able to help us turn the tide in a war that has the universe in the grips of demise.”
Tim was the one that spoke up this time. “Isn’t that a little dramatic?”
“I’m sorry, is it? Your race tends to like things that are over dramatic to build something you call suspense. Why you would want to do that though I never understood. Know that I mean you no harm. This ship doesn’t even have any kind of weapons.”
“Edith, Analyze that statement.”
After a moment, there was a soft ding. “Humanity does have a record of being over dramatic. It is not a logical course of action, but it is the path that humanity has chosen.”
“No, Edith,” Edith never missed a chance to be a royal pain in the butt, and Jaedon’s frustration was clear in his voice, “The other statement. Does he have weapons?”
“You assume that I am male.” This comment came over the communication line.
“Do they have weapons?” Jaedon reiterated, worried about the safety of his ship.
“No, from what I can tell, they have no way to injure this ship.” Edith responded.
“Can we meet?” Tim was the one that asked that.
“Yes, I cannot host you on this ship, but I can come there.”
“How? Do you have a docking collar?” Jaedon inquired
“No, just open an external airlock.”
“I don’t want to meet anyone new right now.” Sam was the one that said this. Alestra spoke up next. “I agree.” They left back toward Sam’s quarters.
Tim rolled his eyes. He never was one to get stuck in emotion like Sam did, although this is the worst Tim has ever seen from him. This is one of the biggest moments for humanity. We have contacted aliens.
“Edith, open external airlock six. You are welcome aboard at any time.” The communications channel closed.
“Now we wait and see if he comes.” Tim said.
“Not he, they. We do not know a gender yet. But yes.” Jaedon agreed on some facts and dissented on others.
On the map the alien ship vanished, a wave of panic gripped both Tim and Jaedon. A microsecond later the ship appeared next to Edith. A camera flicked on to visually inspect the craft. It was nearly double the height of Edith and was bright silver. Shaped like a sewing needle it appeared to be both larger and smaller than Edith. The eye of the needle was glass but very tinted to assure privacy. The needle lowered itself until the eye of it was in line with the external door of airlock six.
The eye of the needle turned transparent. An angel was sitting inside. Clad in white robes with pale skin, it was the halo that most surprised Tim and Jaedon. “Angels are real?” Tim asked
“Apparently so. We aren’t seeing things, are we?” Jaedon felt lost in the moment.
Allorien stood up and casually stepped though the wall protecting them from the vacuum of space. Allorien walked into the airlock. A few moments later his halo spun enlarged in size and then shrunk. It then returned to normal size with an audible pop. His ship vanished. Watching through the camera system Jaedon noticed something, “Zoom in the right shoulder!”
Edith was quick to react and did as commanded. There was an emblem of a silver sewing needle stitched into the right shoulder of his robe. “That was not there a moment, ago right?” Jaedon asked.
“I don’t think so...” Tim stood there, eyes wide, and mouth agape.
They both looked at the camera which zoomed back out. Allorien took a deep breath and nodded. “Edith, let him in.” The door closed behind Allorien and the door opened in front. “Guide him to the conference room.” A series of green arrows appeared on the floor in front of Allorien and he started walking along them. “Edith, head back into the asteroid field. Shall we?” Jaedon asked toward Tim.
“Yes, of course. This is monumental.” Tim responded.
“More than you know.”
