Gwen sighed heavily. She had a compact disk in her hand, they had long since gone out of date, but she thought they sounded better than the new medium. She placed it into a slot in her wall and cranked it up. The room started shaking softly from the music.
Music had become visual. Digital Graphics became so advanced that they replicated the sense of sound visually. The brain interpreted these videos as sound. The popularity of this new ‘music’ grew so much that most audio musicians went out of business. She missed it though. There was something about having the waves go through the air and fill them with sound that was satisfying to her.
She sat down at her desk and looked at pictures of herself when she was younger. How could someone take her memories then return them? What devious science would they have to have to do that. They even filled her mind with false feelings and memories of her parents dying.
She considered the concept of memories so core to someone’s existence removed from someone and false ones added in. She wondered if everyone in that false school had the same issues and their memories wiped. She felt so sorry for the people still there. Then she started thinking about the two people she liked from there and began to tear up slightly. She missed Sam and Tim.
Suddenly her music paused and there was a click of an intercom “Honey, can you come down to the dining room? There’s a call you might want to see.”
“Yes, dad!” When the speaker clicked off, she muttered to herself. “Probably just another diplomat wanting to welcome me home.”
Her head was low, and she sighed. As she walked down the massive hallways in the castle. She hated the life of a princess. She felt confined by society’s rules and expectations. She felt overly cared for and she felt as if she had developed no real skills. If she had wished a servant would have come with a little golf cart to drive her the 5 minutes across the building to the dining room. She honestly preferred the walk. She sighed one more time just before she opened the door.
Gwen walked into the large dining room. Her father and younger brother were sitting at the table looking at the wall behind her. When she turned around and looked at the wall her eyes lit up in a heartbeat. Looking back at her were Tim, Sam, Jaedon, and two people she did not know. One of those people did not look human, and had a halo?
They all looked at her. Jaedon smiled, “Hi Princess, glad to know you got home safely.”
“It’s thanks to you I hear.” Gwen started walking toward her chair.
“No, your government got you released. They didn’t do the same for these two though, so we had to break them out.” Jaedon explained, Alestra laughed at this comment.
“Okay so, who are you?” Gwen asked back at the laughing face.
“My name is Alestra. Jaedon and I work for your father. We used to work for the Government of Venus as Special Operations Agents, in many ways we still do. However, our true allegiance is yours, so that bit is a secret from most people.”
Gwen took a sit in her chair next to her father. Tim and Sam both smiled at her and she smiled back. Then her mind questioned who the other person was, but her dad beat her to it. “So, the other question is, who is he?”
Allorien’s halo shook slightly and he spoke using no mouth. “My name is Allorien. We have no gender. I am a representative of the race of beings called the Crysix.”
Jaedon continued, “It appears, they have been watching us since the beginning of our existence. They have been waiting for us to finally contact them. It took Tim to do that while we were traveling. However, I do not want to continue with my official orders.”
“Your official orders are? I remember them aligning well with what I needed you to do.” King Romulus inquired.
“To return all rescued parties directly to Senator Le’Rue.”
“Yeah, we should not do that. Senator Le’Rue would use the knowledge of Allorien to advance his own political agenda. The knowledge of the Crysix stand for something much greater I feel.” The king shifted slightly in his seat. “When is Senator Le’Rue expecting you?”
“Fifteen Days. I got approval for a two-day layover at my home. We can be there in thirteen. Do you have a way to hide my ship during those two days?”
“Yes. Come here instead. The eight of us should have dinner.” Gwen smiled broadly when her father said that.
