Mars - Dorsa Argentea
Separated from the war on the equator the south pole of Mars hosted an icy castle. Austral Citadel was covered in carbon dioxide ice. While the castle’s skirt of ice came and went with the seasons, the castle was always there. The interior of the structure of the castle was steel and concrete. Inside the castle was warm and inviting. The outer shell was only a facade designed for intimidation. It was successful. The castle got very few visitors despite the fact that the residents were the monarchs of Mars’ southern half.
The bedroom was austere and gilded in gold. The value of it was not appreciated by the primary resident. The young prince had long dirty blond hair and spotless pajamas. It was time for him to go to bed. His mother, the queen, and his father, who was not a king, sat with him on the extremely large four post bed.
He looked at his golden-haired mother, with love but also maturity. On Mars children grew up too quickly. He was only a child, but he knew he would be king during a war. His mother was queen during a war; his grandfather and great grandfather were also kings during wartime. Most people believed he would continue the war. At ten, he thought everyone should get along. Nobody saw the hidden maturity in his eyes. Most of the time his concerns were written off as wishful thinking. He turned toward his dark haired father, “Why do we have to fight dad?”
“Jamie, Mars is a place where our way of living and another, different way of living exist together. Every time those two ways have existed side by side, fighting has occurred.”
“They aren’t that different from us, why should we keep fighting?”
“Now son,” His mother spoke up at this point, “We don’t really have a choice. We are a colony of Terra Firma. We must follow the directions of Chancellor Zion.” Jamie shivered. His parents decided that was the best time to leave him to bed. They both got up, kissed him on the forehead and went toward the door. As she reached the door, Jamie questioned Queen Hedlund. “Have we even spoken with the other side?”
She glanced back but didn’t turn all the way around, “No, we would quickly lose our power if we did so.” She and her partner quickly walked the rest of the way to the door and clicked off the crystal chandelier. Just before leaving and closing the door she said, “We would be freezing out on the streets.”
Jamie considered this and decided that maybe it is best just to follow orders.
