Terra Firma - New York City
His research books and scientific experiments would have been unheard of, even as late as the 23rd Century. An older man at a lab table looking at a new book entitled “A History of Light” published on the history of the years 100 B.C. - 100 A.D. His study was to line up history, science, and theology. He was of Ukrainian descent and had always had an interest, however, he was one of the first that that had major breakthroughs. His study was to perfect a series of beliefs that aligned with science and gave all that religion needed to provide.
Religion in history has explained the things science could not. It gave comfort when science could not. It gave answers when facts could not. Religions had come and gone, most of the time because, they conflicted with the political systems of the day. He knew more than anyone else on the planet on the interplay of history, science, and religion.
He was proud of his recent accomplishments, yet his boss was holding them back from the public. He was angry with the government which paid him and funding his experiments. They did not let him say what he saw. He looked up to his wall, and saw the quote that has inspired him most over the course of his life. “See first, think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting.”
His blood boiled as he read this new book. It completely discounted the Bible while he knew portions of the Bible to be true. Dr. Palnov had recently found the remains of a major player in the Bible. Not in physical life, but in the buried memories of a past life of a student of his. Because some of the events of the Bible contradicted known facts the “historian” of this book discounted the entire Bible. Dr. Palnov knew that this historian had been wrong. If only...
His supervisor a young man in his thirties, burst into the room. He walked up to the other side of the lab table. “Good, you’re reading it, what can we use to defeat it?” Dr. Palnov. looked up at him upset.
“I already handed you the information you needed to defeat this drivel. You did not let me publish one of my greatest studies. Publishing my study will negate this book.” He threw his study across the table at his supervisor. “No more work is required.”
The report “Studies into ancient memories; proof of reincarnation,” slid across the table.
