September 16, 2550 C.E.
Mars - Dorsa Argentea
The room was dark and cold. It was not cold because the building was coated in ice; he just liked it that way. One wall was a series of screens that had on many television programs at once. He chose which one had sound at any give time. As a prince it was his job to study the political narratives and power players in the solar system. However, this particular news item struck him as odd. He read the headline again. “Dr. Palnov brutally murdered by Venusian Special Forces.” He changed the sound over to that program.
“—Was one of the first graduates of The Columbia University school of Religious Science…” This was the only organization carrying this particular news item. Jamie knew, when only one news outlet carried a story it was usually a path to a hidden truth. This particular news story was only on Terra Firma’s official news channel. No other independent or Venusian news channel was carrying it. He pulled out a binder and took notes on the story.
“Fredrick Palnov was responsible for many breakthroughs in science and religion. He was found murdered in his laboratory on September 4th,” The news story continued. Jamie wrote into the notebook the fact that the news story was twelve days late. “He single handedly proved that science and religion can go hand. He wrote many essays and books on the topic. Well respected in all scientific and religious circles he worked directly for our glorious chancellor Zion and was personal friends with the archbishop of the Unified Christian Church. He was orphaned at a young age when his parents where killed in a terrorist bombing in London also arranged by Venusian Special Forces Military. The Chancellor has promised swift military action against the parties responsible.”
Jamie rolled his eyes. He knew that meant another battle will happen on Mars. There is already nothing but war on Mars. Terra Firma can’t attack Venus right now, so they just take it out on Mars. Just then the door opened and his father walked in. Jamie quickly muted the TV as his father came to sit by him. “Jamie, there’s something I have to tell you.”
The, now 19 year old, turned to his father with concern. “What’s that dad?”
The middle aged man shifted uncomfortably. “You know that I am your father and will always love you. As well you know that I am not allowed to marry your mother.”
“Not allowed to?” Jamie had never heard him use this phrasing before.
“Yes, The Chancellor will not allow us to marry. It was his condition for allowing me to stay alive. Your mother bargained for my life.” He could see his son was shocked.
“Why? Why would she have to do that? Who is this Chancellor?” The prince was astounded the leader of his government would force someone to bargain for the life of someone they love.
“You will find out who he is in time. What is important for you to know now is my past.” Serim Aktug swallowed deeply. “Before I fell in love with your mother I was a member of an elite team in the Venusian Military. I grew up on the other side of Mars. I was recruited by their military because I was sick of constant fighting and I vowed to put an end to it. I became a corporal and had many skills which I hated. I was in line for the biggest job, it would end the war and bring peace. At least I thought so. My assignment was to assassinate your mother.”
Jamie gasped, and jumped off of the plush couch. Jamie put his fists up to his father ready to punch him.
“Whoa, I didn’t do it did I?” his father found himself bargaining again, this time to keep his son’s anger at bay.
Jamie put his fists down, but wasn’t convinced. “You’re still the enemy.” Somehow hearing this news made the room feel even colder.
Serim sighed, “That is the kind of thinking that created a rule that I cannot marry the woman I love. When your mother and I fell in love I told my superiors and she told the Chancellor. My superiors demanded I continue with my mission. The Chancellor wanted me dead, and he didn’t even know who I really was, just that I was from the north. Please, son, sit.”
Jamie begrudgingly relaxed a little bit and sat back down with his father as he continued the story that happened before his own life.
“Your mother and I tried to build a bridge between worlds. We tried to unite Mars. Both the Venusian Government and the Terra Firma Government strongly opposed the union, and our love. It wasn’t long until we found out she was pregnant. Both sides wanted to use you, use us, as their pawn to win the war and declare victory. That’s when we learned, nobody cares about Mars and its people. The whole planet is a bargaining chip. A card to be played. We refused to accept that.” Serim’s dedication was clear in his voice.
“When you were born the Terra Firma government was nice enough to give me a new identity so that I could be your father and help you grow. I promised never to tell you all this information. My real name is Serim Aktug. If anyone can continue our dream of building a bridge between the cultures it is you. I don’t even know if you believe me.” He reached out to hug his son. Jamie hugged back.
