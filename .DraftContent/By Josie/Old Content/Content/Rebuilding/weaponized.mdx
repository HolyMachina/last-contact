“It has only been seven years since we were in this room and we were all surprised that Humanity had made contact with us.” Taurnil Ildilyntra was sitting around the same table she sat seven years ago. “Humanity has grown a great deal since then.” She paused leaned forward and crossed her hands in front of her mouth. “They know of our existence, we have even protected some of them in their war against another faction. However, we have managed to keep our biggest secret from them. It is time to reveal the full truth to them and to eliminate the rest of the children.”
There was havoc around the table. The other Elessar objected to the idea that their charges may be eliminated. Gildor Caigolor stood up and slammed his hand on the table. “Hold on. Look at the chaos this has created. We are better than this.” Silence floated across the table. “This kind of chaos is what we would expect from our enemies not ourselves, we are above this.” He sat back down and calmly turned back to Ildilyntra. “Okay, convince us.”
The Crysix have a calm procedure for everything and this was no exception. Now the procedure had been started. It had only happened once before in the history of the universe. That had ended in a mass extinction of over four hundred living races.
Ildilyntra stood in the front of the room “As you all know the history of humanity has been filled with war.” She began to pace. “In fact one of them was even termed as ‘the war to end all wars.’ At this point they have finally fraught that ward and are not at combat within themselves.” She spun at the end of the room and her robes fluttered around her.
The leader of the team spoke up. “How can you be so sure? Every time we hear this about humans they start fighting over this thing they call religion.” This made her pause. She turned toward him. Her halo spun quickly and she said “but isn’t that our fault?” She stared into his eyes. “We gave them those beliefs. A couple of our Mahtan, against our wishes, interfered with their development and provided information to them about us which lead to the rise of religion.”
“What we provided them may be our fault. However, what they do with it is their own.” He shook his head. “In light of this we will—”
“They know us now. Why can’t we just tell them how their religion came to be and that it was all made in our own image?” She stared into the darkened eyes of her supervisor and he vanished. She sat back down calmly and there was silence in the room. They all knew what happened.
A couple of moments later he appeared again. “I have consulted with the Gelmir. We are going to proceed with humanity however, they will be expected to figure it out before another race contacts us. Elessar, if the race under your care has not traveled into space, prepare for their extinction. They will not have time to catch up.”
