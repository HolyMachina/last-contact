June 5, 2559 C.E.
Venus - Uninhabited Land
The small craft was crowded despite there only being three people on it. Jaedon was flying it he was headed toward coordinates on the other side of Venus. A wall of clouds was approaching them and he had orders to drive straight into it. Le’Rue smirked from the copilot’s seat. As they flew into the acidic clouds the ship shook dramatically. Alestra was the first to speak, “I hope you know what you’re doing.”
Jaedon snipped back “Following orders has never lead me wrong.” However, Alestra could tell the hidden message of ‘If you can trust the orders.’
“You two better be able to get along better than it seems.” Le’Rue was skeptical of what he was about to do. He missed the hidden layer of the friendship, and deeper communication between them. The small craft arced sideways though the high winds and acidic rain. It was an extremely turbulent flight.
After about half an hour a small blip appeared on the screen. It looked to be a building hidden inside the contaminated airs of Venus in a section of the planet that had not been populated yet. “This is what we’ve come to see. This building, and its contents were built in secret to help us win the war.” As the flew closer the building got progressively larger. What started as a small blip on a screen twenty minutes had a door open on one side that was a minuscule portion of the wall. That small door swallowed their three person transport ship whole.
As the ship went inside it was clear it was a construction facility, and there was a much larger ship inside. “How big is it?” Jaedon was surprised that something this scale could have been built in secret. As they flew in they began to fly over the ship. It was clear their tiny transport had no business being in the building. As they flew over the large craft it looked like a sleek craft designed to impress the people that came in front of it. It had large windows that spanned many decks on the inside. As well as a great deal of decorative metals and symbols etched into the outer hull. There were few armaments in this area of the ship, it looked almost like a diplomatic vessel. Inside it appeared as if most of the area was residences, cafes and other living spaces. It did not look like a vessel of war.
Le’Rue answered him calmly with an air of superiority. “It is the largest spaceship ever constructed in the history of humanity. It is seventy kilometers long, and ten kilometers wide. It will have a crew of 350 thousand soldiers. Among them will be the two of you. General Mustang you will be the commanding officer of this vessel. You have been promoted to General of the Army. You will also now be the highest ranking member of the Venusian Military and therefore everyone will end up reporting to you, of course, you will continue to report to me.” This surprised the newfound General and the ship dipped slightly it briefly scrapped against the edge of the larger ship. Everyone looked toward Jaedon and he gathered himself and they were back on course.
Le’Rue looked at Alestra and continued, “Colonel Amalee, you are now second in command of this vessel. You will be one of many Colonels in our military that report to our first combat General. In his absence this beautiful thing is your ship. This ship has been called the Hurricane.” About ten minutes had passed since they entered the building and they were roughly a third of the way down the ship. The demeanor of the vessel changed. The vessel was now clearly a vessel of war. There were armaments, gun turrets and missile launchers. No windows were present on the back two thirds of the vessel. There were also large exposed wires across sections of the ship. The Hurricane’s construction in this section appeared incomplete and fundamentally flawed. Alestra was the one that noticed. “Are those wires supposed to be exposed?”
“Yes, they are a decoy. They serve no functional purpose however, they are designed to draw fire of enemy craft to bring them to the more well armored part of the shift. What’s more important is the fins.” Jaedon and Alestra’s eyes both refocused a little further down the ship. There was a circular metal ring around the circumference of the Hurricane. Attached to the ring were five large metal fins, it appeared like a fan. There were four other sets of these rings and fins further down the ship.
Le’Rue explained, “Throughout human history natural disasters have taken a significant toll on the lives of people while being a less cause of death. We decided that if we could end the war though a combination of natural disasters and specific strikes we may be able to win the war with as little bloodshed and possible. So we created the Hurricane.” He smirked slightly. “This ship was designed to cause pain without causing death. The fins, when placed into the atmosphere of a planet and spun at certain speeds should generate the hurricanes that can be then be released to cause the pain.”
“A seemingly noble way to fight a war.” Jaedon had hesitation in his voice. “Hurricanes still cause a lot of death, I hesitate a little more because we are causing death to people who did not sign up to fight instead.” He shifted slightly and the ship they were in rocked a little because of his balance. “Additionally, I don’t think just from a couple of storms the Terra Firma government will surrender. Are we going to have a chance to inspect the vessel?”
“Yes.” As Le’Rue answered a door opened between the second and third set of fins. “Head there. It is honestly time for the ship’s first flight test. I thought you both should be present for it.” As the small transport vessel flew into the larger ship it was clear this was a landing bay. The largest one he had ever seen. Roughly fifty thousand soldiers packed the floor to see the arrival of their commanding officer and executive officer. As the small ship landed the soldiers broke and made a gap that the ship could land in. It was clear were they were designed to land because the brass stood in front of the space. Jaedon expertly landed the small craft in the middle of all the officers. As they walked down the ramp the officers saluted them. Jaedon shivered and gave his first command on the new, large vessel. “Do not salute on this vessel.” The soldiers looked confused and held their salute. Jaedon returned their salute and proceeded to the small podium that had been setup for their arrival.
Jaedon stood at the podium with Alestra at his right and Le’Rue at his left. “My first command on this glorious vessel was ignored. What is your name?” he looked directly at the highest in command at the time. A tall muscular man responded in a deep voice responded. “Major Mazen Basara, Engineering Department” Jaedon glared down at the Major. “Well, Major Basara, you heard my first command and you appear to be highest in command at the moment. I will hold you responsible for ignoring it. If that happens again you will be demoted.” Major Basara was clearly intimidated and not prepared for a commander that was this strict. A smirk curled across Le’Rue’s face. Jaedon continued, “This is a vessel of the Venusian military and I am its commanding officer. This is my vessel and you are all now playing by my rules. This,” he motioned to Alestra, “is my executive officer Alestra. Do not, call me General Mustang. Do not call her Colonel Amalee. We are a family. Do you call any of your family members by their last name?”
He shifted slightly loosening up his body language. “This is my first official command to my crew: We are a family, we treat each other in a casual manner, and most importantly with mutual respect. Uniforms are optional dress as you wish. Salutes are optional. I am Jaedon. However, you are still in the military. I will give few commands but I am still your commanding officer, follow my lead, but openly question me if you think I am doing something immoral. If you cannot follow this direction. Leave my vessel now.” Many of crew, including the Major smiled widely.
Le’Rue looked at Jaedon and scowled.
