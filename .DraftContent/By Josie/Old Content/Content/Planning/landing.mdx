Venus Orbit - Descending Toward Avalon
With Jaedon in pilot’s seat, Alestra in the Co-pilots seat and Sam and Tim in the passenger seats in the cockpit they were all strapped in very tightly. Allorien was standing behind Sam and Tim. It was clear it would not be a soft landing. Jadon was the first to break the silence. “We are going to be approaching the planet at speeds near the capabilities of this ship, the shield should just barely hold. The reason for the entry to the contaminated side of Venus is that the Senate is not expecting us for a couple more days, they would know something is up if we come early.”
Edith dropped from upper orbit on the uninhabited side of Venus. Xavix had memorized a chart of all known Venusian satellites and expertly guided Edith away from them at great speed. Tim was the first to say anything “You are quite good at this.”
Jaedon smirked, “This is not the first time I have come to this planet discreetly.”
One of the control panels turned red and a high-pitched sound throughout the hull. Everyone looked up to the navigation screen it displayed a collision warning.
“Edith, show it to me.”
On the screen popped up a satellite that Jaedon had never seen before. He thought aloud in stressful situations. “A new satellite? Is there an emblem? Zoom in!” The camera magnified to show the symbol of the Terra Firma News Agency. “Edith, what can we do?”
The AI of the ship responded, “Very little, there is not enough time to engage weaponry, and it has too much mass to ram safely. We are moving too fast to adjust course meaningfully before impact”
Allorien spoke up from the rear of the cockpit. “go ahead and ram it.”
Edith spoke up. “There is no physical way that would result safely.”
Jaedon turned to Allorien, “are you sure?”
Allorien nodded, and then closed his eyes. He sat down on the floor. As they were about to contact the satellite it gracefully moved around the ship and perfectly resumed its normal orbit. Four jaws dropped to the floor.
It took Jaedon a moment to recover. “Okay, Edith, Shields up for entry to Venus West.”
“No more tricks from the alien?” Edith responded sarcastically.
“Edith, we’ve talked about this, everyone has different gifts. We need to respect those.” He turned to Allorien, “I’m sorry, she gets very stubborn about things she doesn’t understand. Although, like her I am curious as to what you did. I guess curiosity runs in the family.”
Ylena looked back to Jaedon, “She’s your family? That’s her Eagle Scout badge isn’t it? That explains why she keeps calling me ma’am.”
Each person on the ship felt the computer roll its proverbial eyes. “Yeah, I wish my great, great, great, great, grandson would stop telling me to. It’s a sign of respect from one transwoman to another.”
Jaedon lost his cool, “Stop it!”
Edith responded, “So I should just get back to the work of controlling a space ship yes?”
A sigh came with one simple word, “Yes.”
The rainbow paint melted off the ship to expose a gleaming silver. After a couple of moments, the external silver glowed green. These shields designed specifically for the for the acidic clouds of Venus forced the paint of the ship to melt away into space.
As they hit the atmosphere of Venus the ship buffeted. Jaedon kept an eye on the shields which quickly went down to ninety-two percent. The shield was clicking down too fast, they would never reach the ground. Everyone’s eyes seemed locked on that. “Edith, why are the shields so low already?”
“Your piloting my dear, we are entering the atmosphere at the wrong angle.”
“I got it,” Alestra took the controls and tapped them slightly. The shield started going down significantly more slowly. “We should be fine now.”
“Confirmed. The shields should now hold all the way through the clouds.” Edith responded.
“I never was good with the delicate details.” Jaedon remarked
“That’s why women exist.” Alestra giggled
The ship tore into the clouds and the shield started dropping quickly again. When it got to twenty percent, Sam and Tim both raised their concerns.
“Don’t worry we’ll be breaking though any moment.”
The ship leveled out and they could see the surface of Venus on the radar. Orange and yellow clouds covered the visual screens. They broke through the clouds and a large castle was directly in-front of them. Another ‘impact warning’ appeared on the screen. Allorien found the situational footing first, “Do I need to do something about this?”
“Not this time, my friend.”
The ship abruptly tilted down and a section of ground opened to reveal a hidden landing ramp which lead into a large, ornate, landing bay. The ship’s external camera focused on a man in blue robes, a boy in red robes, and a young woman in a white dress wearing a tiara and smiling sincerely. Sam’s eyes lit up with the recognition of someone he missed dearly.
Alestra was the first for situational footing this time, “Welcome to the home of the royal family of Venus.”
