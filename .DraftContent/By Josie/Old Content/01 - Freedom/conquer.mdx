September 2, 2550 C.E
Terra Firma - New York City
1983 saw the construction of the 664-foot-high tower. It never closed since it opened. The labeling “Impulse” was over the main door although the “P” was of a different font as if it was there before the rest of the lettering was. Resting on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 56th street, a former Gucci store was now a governmental agency for complaints. It is not a popular place, because everyone who goes in there, never comes out. The company of a former president owned the tower until the US government bought it to serve a purpose. The building was no longer mixed use. It was a fully governmental building. After the White House burned down in a tragic accident, the entirety of the US Government moved to New York.
Six generals walked up to a golden elevator. They pressed no button, but the elevator knew they were there. They were all bald white men of about the same height and build. They wore four different uniforms. Though the uniforms had recently changed they still showed the same meanings. The dominant colors stood for the government’s control over current aspects of their agency. All of them were complete except one. A dark blue uniform to show the entirety of the planets oceans; light blue over the skies; green over the entire land of the planet. The last uniform had some poorly sown on patches. A half circle patch was red, a large full circle was orange, and a small full circle was gray. The patches marred the beauty of the full black uniform.
The doors opened and the six stepped inside. The elevator took them to the three-floor penthouse, at the top of the tower which serves a dual purpose of residence, for and the seat of, the entire government of the planet formerly named Earth. The six of them received direction to come up here for a meeting scheduled to last four hours. When the elevator doors opened they saw a tall man in a business suit that had the matching colorings of each of their suits. The same patches marred the black areas. Even though he was tall, his frame was very thin, his long black hair was a symbol of how long he had been sitting as Chancellor of Terra Firma. “Conquer them, like I conquer you.”
Chancellor Fulton raised a weapon to one of the generals wearing the black uniform. He pulled the trigger and the general fell to the floor of the elevator. “See? It’s easy.” The doors closed and the elevator began to move back down. The Chancellor sighed. “I hate having to make statements and shows like that.” He turned to his chief of staff. “Master Vera’Cruz, appoint a new vice chairman, make sure he comes from the same branch. The vice anything can always a symbol.”
