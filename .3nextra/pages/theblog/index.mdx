# About The Blog

## Where did I find myself?

Well... This is my blog.

It's a blog.

Like any other blog.

Except... There's one section called "World Events" where these events have, or will, directly impacted the Last Contact universe.

The views are my own and not that of my company or any of the characters in Last Contact.

## Sections?

- World Events: These are events that happened in real life that *directly impact* the Last Contact story.
- Technology: This is where I'll talk about my various takes on technology.
- Politics: This is where I'll talk about my various takes on politics.
- Transgender Life: This is where I'll talk about my various takes on being a transgender person and what that's like.
- Site News: This is where I'll put meta-ish news about the site.
