# History Class

## January 20, 2284 CE

### Saturn

Saturn was mostly unpopulated. Humans had still not found a way to colonize gas giants in a massive way. However, covert bases had been setup by both Terra Firma and Venus. Largely unknown by the other faction, many of these bases remain hidden on moons around the four gas giants in the solar system. However, one of Terra Firma's was well known by Venus, and even had a Venusian covert special forces member based inside it on a mission to rescue people.

#### Tethys (3rd Moon) - Ithaca Chasma

A large chasm scarred across Tethys' face from north to south. There was a large wall between the end of the chasm and a large crater named Telemachus. Three large domes existed sitting at the end of the chasm. On the other side of the wall exiting into the crater a large set of doors began to creak open as a large transport ship streaked toward it.

##### Terra Firma Dissident Prison Complex

"You are cleared to land. Landing bay six, dock twenty-two. Welcome to Tethys, your ship wil be inspected, and then the dissidents will be unloaded and transferred to the prison. You will leave empty as always."

"Acknowledged. Six, twenty-two." The pilot of the regular transport from Terra Firma to Tethys responded as it flew with expertise toward the doors built into the side of Telemachus and under the Ithaca Chasma.

##### Calypso University - Lecture Room 29

Mr. Beyar was tall, and had an athletic build. He had dark hair and blue eyes. He did not like this room. It was a large amphitheater type room. The walls were all white and there was an antique projector from the early 21st century in the ceiling that projected up to the front of the room. There was also a Christian cross above the door which made him slightly uncomfortable given his beliefs.

He stood waiting for his first class of the new term to filter in. There was a secret in his smile; everyone had an idea what the secret was, but they were all wrong. His secret was that he was not an average history teacher, in an average college. He stood as he waited for his students to filter in.

Looking at the roster, all of the people he had to look out for were in this class. They walked in together chatting about how nice the weather was. He smiled that secret smile again. He called the class to order "Okay boys and girls, let us get started." Everyone very promptly pulled out their notebooks and pencils and prepared to take notes.

He started lecturing about the course of human events in the nineteen-sixties. Speaking specifically on the push for freedom, he glossed over the idea enforced by the curriculum that freedom had costs and would cause chaos in the future. He was instructed to teach that freedom was a slippery slope into chaos. His curriculum ended in the nineteen-eighties, because his students thought it was 2004. The final message of the class was that capitalism and strong leaders were required to maintain order. He wish he could teach the Iliad and the Odyssey, since that's where all the names of locations on this moon came from. However, in this place, those were banned books. The classroom was completely silent except for the droning voice of Mr. Beyar. Normally he is a lot more excited about history but he cannot teach what he knew to last five hundred plus years of history because, to these students... to them it is not history, it is future. If only he could teach them about the resistance that occurred.

About 20 minutes into his lecture one of the students fell asleep. His head hit the desk with a resounding thud. Sharp intake of air. Door flung open. Men in suits. Student dragged out. Door Slam. Deep Exhale. Mr. Beyar laughed slightly, "hopefully we won't have that happen again." The events startled the students in the moment but the class returned to normal quickly. They were startled by the jarring nature, not by what happened, it was normal. If people broke a rule, no matter how slight, security removed them from class to an unknown location. The students may, or may not, ever come back.

As Mr. Beyar was wrapping up his lecture, the bell rang to change classes. He was as happy as any of the students that his lecture was over. However, there was one student he wanted to see just a little bit more. "Tim, if possible, can you stay after class."

There was the requisite taunting from the other students but they did quickly get up and leave. His two friends who he walked in with looked back and Tim fidgeted slightly in his chair. Mr. Beyar was happy to see that Sam and Gwen showed concern about Tim, that would be important for the three of them later. He quickly responded with "Don't worry you aren't in trouble. Tim waived his friends on and they left the room more at ease.

Mr. Beyar got up and motioned Tim to follow him. "Please come to my office." Tim gathered his things and got up slowly. The walk through the first couple of hallways was an odd one, it passed in silence.

"Did I do something, sir?"

Mr. Beyar laughed with a certain timber that carried the â€˜I wish I could tell you the truth.' message. After the laugh had passed he responded with "No, of course not, you are a wonderful student. In fact, I would like you mentor you in a couple of things that I think you might be interested in learning."
Tim looked at him questioningly. "Are you, sure, that's okay?"

"Yeah," Mr. Beyar answered, "I have noticed you can do some things that seem odd or strange, can't you?" They were now outside of the building walking down a path way near the largest building on campus, they passed a giant tower with a great deal of emergency sirens and bells. Tim seemed a little zoned out, and Mr. Beyar threw a light punch at his face. Tim blocked it with a super-human reaction time.

"It is those skills which I would like to grow in you. A normal person would not have been able to block me, especially when distracted like that. What if I told you that you had skills far beyond what is considered normal in this time?"

Tim just looked at him for a moment as they kept walking to the office of a special forces warrior.
