# Last Contact

## New Chapters Every Friday

My plan is to post new chapters of the book "Last Contact" at some point every Friday. (US Central Time)

## Start Here

Last contact is a website that is mostly based around a science fiction universe. In the my head this is an epic story of where humanity might be in the 23rd and 24th centuries. The story and universe continue to evolve as I write it based on historical or current events that I encounter and are emotionally significant to me. The site has four main content sections three of which are in a blog format, the last of which is a series of static pages. Each section and it's purpose is detailed below in [The Sections](#the-sections).

### How to Read Last Contact

To read the content of Last Contact there are effectively three ways to do it. The book is written in Acts. The chapters within the act acts are in chronological order but the acts occur in overlapping timeframes. Chapters release in no specific order. The story can effectively be read in one of three ways:

- Act Order (the intended order): Start with the [Prologue](./lastcontact/prologue/index.mdx) and read the first chapter. Use the navigation links at the bottom of the page to proceed to the next chapter throughout the book.
- Chronological Order: You can use the [Timeline](./lastcontact/compendium/) to see a chronological list of all the chapters across acts. Come back to the timeline after each chapter.
- Character Order: *Coming Soon*
- Release Order: Once you're caught up and reading as I release you can read week by week along with the release of the book using the [Last Changes](#last-10-changes) table below.
