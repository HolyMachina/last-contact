# World War Five

## July 19, 2286

### Mars, Dorsa Argentea

#### Planum Castle

#### Media Room

Jamie sat in front of a wall of fifteen television screens arranged on a wall in a large recliner with a bunch of buttons on the arm. All fifteen screens had different content. All of them had closed captioning on. Six TVs had a green outline and their sound was sent to one speaker each around the room. Jamie was gifted with the ability to consume multiple streams of information at once. Now at nineteen he understood more about his gifts, skills, and abilities. This was how he kept himself informed; he had never been allowed out of the castle. He was too important and still too young. He was a prince. His planet was at war. He felt the desire to consume everything he could within the walls of his castle.

The green border focused on just one of the screens as the audio turned up for that specific broadcast. He wanted to focus specifically on what the Venusian News Network was saying. Those networks are new. Jamie wasn't sure why they popped up on his TV, but he was grateful.

A very young red haired woman spoke. She was the youngest anchor in the history of the channel. "The fifth human civil war, is raging still on Mars and throughout the solar system in periodic battles in space." The Venusian media agencies dropped the "World War" nomenclature when Venus was founded. They started calling wars between all of humanity "Human Civil Wars." The people of Venus were weird Jamie always thought. It was weird that the people of Venus, after all they had been though, considered Terra Firma and all the other planets their same people. Terra Firma did everything they could to pretend Venus didn't exist. The planet of Mars was the only one that had access to every human news agency in the solar system. Most news agencies focused on a specific planet, region, or governmental body, Mars was half owned by the Terra Firma Empire and half by the Venusian Republic.

The images of the active TV showed a section of the martian landscape that had a field of wrecked spacecraft that had fallen to the surface of Mars, it was dotted with spacecraft of both Venusian and Terra Firma emblems. "It's a shame, this fight has caused so much death, pain, and loss on both sides of the conflict" the reporter said. "At least it doesn't harm the people that live on Mars" Jamie muttered under his breath. He paused this screen on the screenshot and started clicking though other screens. As the voices changed so fast nobody but him would be able to keep up.

He landed on a Terra Firma broadcast showing the exact same view of ruined ships and on the field of Mars. The broadcaster said, "it is clear Terra Firma is proving to be extremely victorious." He paused that one and now the two shots were exactly side by side. He clicked a few buttons and expanded both the images so that they took up the full size of the fifteen screens. The Venusian image had a few less Venusian ships downed than Terra Firma ships. The Terra Firma broadcast had 4 Venusian ship downed for each Terra Firma ship.

"Hey Dad!" Jamie called out the door. Knowing his father was in the room next door.

"Yes Jamie?"

"Hey, come here."

The not King of Mars who was married to the Queen stepped into the room. "Oh boy, what were you looking at?"

"The News," Jamie responded sarcastically. He'd been watching the news since he was thirteen. At least he was old enough that his parents didn't push him away from it. Jamie turned to him looking extremely serious. "I want to understand the universe around me.

"You are a very mature and well thought out young man."

Jamie breezed past the compliment and pointed at the screens. "Can you get me the real image of what they're showing there."

"Sure, I'll send a drone out there this afternoon to get an image. Save those two images." The Queen's husband looked up to the screens. "They're both clearly lying. Why do you care?"

"Even if they're both lying... who's lying more still matters."

## War Room

"Hey Jamie?" The not king of Mars stuck his head out of the fortified steel doors. The war room and the media room were right next to each other. His dad didn't know he was there, but it had only been a couple hours, he was probably still there. Actually, he was always there these days.

"Yeah Dad?" The shout came from the room next door, as expected.

"We got the drone images from the ship graveyard!"

"Oh! I'll be right there." The room was full of generals from the Terra Firma military and had all kinds of tactical screens and maps all over the wall. In the middle of the room a giant holographic Mars appeared with green, blue, and red dots floating around it. These dots indicated both satellites and ships. The green dots were pretty evenly distributed around the planet and indicated civilian and news satellites. Every once in a while a green dot came from the surface and flew away from the planet. A civilian trade ship. The count of green dots had doubled recently. There the red dots, representing friendly Terra Firma military ships were spaced pretty evenly across the southern hemisphere of the planet, there was a grouping near the southern pole above the castle. The blue ships, representing enemy Venusian military aircraft were distributed evenly around the northern hemisphere except a cluster near the north pole. However, there was a large red and blue ring around the equator of Mars. A constant combat like a belt.

As Jamie walked in all the Terra Firma generals turned to salute. Jamie knew it wasn't out of respect but rather out of saving face. He waved them off dismissively.
