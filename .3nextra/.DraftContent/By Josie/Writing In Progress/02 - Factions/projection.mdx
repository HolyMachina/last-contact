Allorien had converted Tim's practice room into something more apt for magical training. The bright lights in the room did not function anymore. No electricity flowed to the room anymore, Allorien claimed it would be a hindrance. The floor had a covering of dirt. There were candles all over the room. They offered the only light in the room. In one corner, there was a small pond that had a water flow, but it had no source or destination. There was also an airflow though the room that was beyond any known in the spacecraft.
Allorien knew Jaedon wanted to watch, but since there was no electricity flowing to that room, the cameras did not work. Allorien saw in Jaedon understanding and control of the energy but not enough power to mold it. Allorien motioned for Tim to sit on the ground in the middle of the room. They both sat down and Allorien said "This is going to feel like an invasion of your mind, and of your deepest secrets. However, know that I will do no such thing. I will be connecting with you on a level that no human has ever connected before. Be calm. Don't panic."
Tim breathed deeply. The next time he blinked he awoke in a city of crystal and glass standing next to Allorien. He felt oddly calm, but very confused. "Where are we, weren't we on a spaceship?"
"We are, this is a mental projection." Tim passed out; his body could not handle the amount of added information passing though his mind.
About an hour later Tim woke up laying on the dirt in the candlelit room. "You stood in the memories of my home. I'm sorry, that was too much." Allorien really thought he was ready, he was sitting calmly across from the collapsed Tim.
"No, it's fine, I just was surprised." Tim got to a sitting position in the dirt. "I have always wondered; if you have no mouth, how do you speak?"
"Our anatomy is like yours, but not quite the same. We have an Adam's apple as you call it." Allorien rubbed their neck and the voice changed as Allorien made a couple of sounds of varying pitch. "Since we are agender everyone has it in our species. We use it for speech like in your case. However, we cannot speak until it grows in puberty. Until then we must communicate though telepathy. If you watch closely both my halo and my neck move during my speech." Allorien moved his neck and halo in a series of vibrations. "My neck vibrates the air around me to create a series of pitches, and my ring pushes that air toward you."
Suddenly Allorien's halo stopped moving. Tim heard a faint whisper. "If the air is not moved to you it creates a faint whisper there is no volume. The faster the air moves, the more volume we create."
Then Allorien's halo spun and his neck did not move. Tim felt a rush of air fly by his ears, but there was no speech carried. Allorien's halo calmed and waved back and forth in a hypnotizing manner. His head echoed with a telepathic explanation. "When my neck doesn't move the only sound is the wind. When I do telepathy it only needs my ring. Since we are born with those, we can speak but not audibly until puberty."
Tim took all this in, there is such a difference in experience in the universe. To think that humans, for so long, had presumed they were alone. "How big is the universe?"
"That is something even we are unsure of, however, when you consider the energies of the universe you can find a calm that makes sense." Allorien stood up and waved his hand, his halo started spinning and the dirt in the room whipped up by the wind into a tornado no larger than Tim. The tornado circled around Tim a couple of times as he kept speaking. "As all the elements travel around us, they are manipulated by us. As you learn to control it you can do it by thought but many people manipulate these energies by their emotion and without thinking."
Allorien sat down, the tornado still twisting around Tim. Allorien's halo was rotating at the same speed as the small tornado. "Your species has called this magic. It is the art of twisting and bending a series of elements to your will. It is the most powerful tool we have and runs most of our lives. It also provides an infinite source of energy, and food." Allorien exhaled and the dirt in the tornado fell straight to the ground.
If Tim did not see it with his own eyes, he would not believe it. Sure, his parents were teaching him when it was young, but this is amazing. This could be a revolution for humanity. Why hasn't humanity developed it? Why did Terra Firma outlaw it? Why did Venus not study it more?
"Because it takes a certain amount of skill to see that value. Only one other person has had that amount of skill. He was killed by people who didn't understand."
"How did you..."
"Read your mind? We have connected now. You can see into my mind, and I can see into yours."
"That's creepy." Tim shifted uncomfortably.
"It is by choice; I will never see something past your surface level thoughts unless you let me. Will you let me take you on a trip inside my mind?"
Tim nodded. "Of course, you have already taught me so much."
Allorien sighed deeply.
Tim and Sam were standing on a clear sidewalk. Underneath them a crystal train rushed along a monorail. They saw a young Allorien speaking with an older, Crysix in front of a large crystal and glass building. The older Crysix was preparing Allorien for his role, "You will watch humanity. Some have said they are our worst children; some have said they are our best. It depends on how they grow. Please, come with me."
A second, older Allorien, spoke though the mental projection with Tim's mind. "These are my memories, we cannot interact with them, and they cannot interact or see us. The past cannot change, but I can live it as many times as I want. Please follow me." The four of them started to walk into the building.
