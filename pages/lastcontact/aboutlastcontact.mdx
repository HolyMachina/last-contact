# About Last Contact

## Where did I find myself?
Well this is Last Contact.

It's a sci-fi political thriller space opera... written on this webiste.

It covers my view of what humanity may end up as in the 23rd and 24th centuries (2200-2399).

It tells the story of humanity's last chance for it's own survival.

It will have some stories outside of that timeframe to illistrate some facts about the world.

It's based on a timeline I wrote in 2005 of political and science prodictions that got me from here to there.. but as current events and news happens the timeline, and therefore the story shift slightly to accomidate.

## Sections?

Most of the story occurs in various "Acts" this is the key area of the fiction story/universe.

There is also going to be a deatailed compendium or enyclopedia of places, people, and events... including the intial timeline I wrote in 2005.
