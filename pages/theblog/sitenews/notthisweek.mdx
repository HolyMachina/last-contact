# Not This Week

January 6, 2024

## Farewell

Today is Jan 6th 2024 and for the next couple of days I’m going to be trying to fill my dog’s life with everything she enjoys.

On Jan 8th, we’re going to day goodbye, so I’ll need some time to recover after that.

There will be no update to Last Contact today 1/6, or all next week (1/10 & 1/13) although there may be some ramblings as I process things…

The next update for the Last Contact will be on January 17th
