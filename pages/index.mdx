# Last Contact Starts Here
## I’m trying to be a little funny… but for real start here.
Last contact is a website that is mostly based around a fictional science fiction universe.In the authors head this is an epic story of where humanity might be in the 23rd and 24th centuries.The story and universe continue to evolve as I write it based on historical or current events that I encounter and are emotionally significant to me.The site has four main content sections three of which are in a blog format, the last of which is a series of static pages.Each section and it’s purpose is detailed below.

You are free to read any of the sections, in any order, at any time.On this page the most recent postings from all categories are shown.The titles of each post are links to the actual content; what’s shown on this page is only a summary(excerpt) of the main plot points of actual content kind of like a Netflix episode preview.You can also access the sections(chapters) of each ‘blog’ type post section of the website in the “Chapters / Blogs” navigation on the side bar.
