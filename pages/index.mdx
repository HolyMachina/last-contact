# Last Contact Starts Here

## Updates Every Friday!
Unless something weird happens my plan is to post new chapters of the book "Last Contact" at some point every Friday (US Central Time) weird things happen sometimes, so I'm sorry.

## Start Here.
Last contact is a website that is mostly based around a fictional science fiction universe. In the authors head this is an epic story of where humanity might be in the 23rd and 24th centuries. The story and universe continue to evolve as I write it based on historical or current events that I encounter and are emotionally significant to me. The site has four main content sections three of which are in a blog format, the last of which is a series of static pages. Each section and itâ€™s purpose is detailed below.

## The Sections
- Last Contact: This is a sci-fi political space opera "book" that follows the lives of fictional characters during the 23rd and 24th centuries (2200-2399) of human history. There are some stories from *current times* to center the book on human history. If things in the 'backstory' (current events) I will go in and edit event that occured in the book.
- The Blog: This is a generalized blog and has a couple differnt categories of topics. The blog contains many sections detailed below:
  - World Events: These are events that happened in real life that impact the Last Contact story.
  - Technology: This is where I'll talk about my various takes on technology.
  - Politics: This is where I'll talk about my various takes on politics.
  - Transgender Life: This is where I'll talk about my various takes on being a trans person and what that's like.
  - Site News: This is where I'll put meta-ish news about the site.
- About Josie: This page is bio and profile information about the author of this site.... Me! (Josie!)

## How should I consume it?
You are free to read any of the sections, in any order, at any time. However you want. You can jump around, or stick to the story as it's written.
