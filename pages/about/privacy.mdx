# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
Last Contact is a static website and, by design, has significant limitations in what it can and cannot collect from viewers.

## Personal Data We Collect
We do not collect *any* data from visitors unless you submit feedback though the link on the right. However your data and the sites you visit may still be avalibile to your Internet Service Provider. I do not have access or visbility into any of that data, including your IP Address. 

You can submit issues without providing any personal data. When you use the feedback link it creates an inssue in a private GitHub repository. Please do not submit any personal data though the feedback link unless you are okay with it being avalibile in a private repositiory in GitHub.

We do not use any kind of login or integrations with any companies or systems. We do not engage with advertisements. Therefore we do not collect any personal data related to login or social media, technology companies. We also do not use any kind of cross site tracking system or market research items.

## Cookie Policy
The website is hosted on Microsoft Azure which uses a single cookie called "AARAfinnity." It is used to determine your session to make sure you are always getting data from the same server to improve performance and security as the website is hosted in many servers around the world.

The "AARAfinnity" Cookie is deleted when your browsing session ends. The cookied is not used to track you across websites. It does not contain any personal data and cannot be used to identify you. It vastly improves performace of the site and is considered nessesary for the site to function.

## Retention, Deletion, and Affiliates

We have no affialte programs with any companies, systems, or groups.
