### Planum Castle - Mars

#### Prince’s Quarters

Looking down from his deep blue eyes Jamie Hedlund could see the domed cities of Schmidt, Fontana, Von Karman and Phillips built into the craters pockmarking the south western hemisphere of Mars. He was the heir to the throne, the only prince of Mars. Yet, his role was that of a mouth peice, and his planet was always at war. He looked up and saw the usual combat formation of ships battling over the horizon near the equator. Somehow it was a constant stalemate between the ships of Venus and the ships of Terra Firma. The southern half of Mars was one of the largest colonies of Terra Firma and the northern half was one of the largest colonies of Venus. It’s too bad, he didn’t understand why they had to fight. He’d watched nineteen years of this pointless struggle, he’d watched it since the day he was born. 

The large gilded doors to his room opened his mother, the Queen of Mars, and his father, who was not the King, walked in. Turning, his messy brown hair shuffled slightly. His parents, also blue eyes, both looked concerned. “Mom, Dad, what’s going on?”  

His dad approched first holding out a book.” This is a gift for you. “It comes from a friend of mine.” The only reason he wasn’t a king is because he wasn’t allowed to be. He wasn’t a citizen of Mars, or even Terra Firma. He was a citizen of Venus, specically Venus’ colony on Pluto. “Suffice to say, if anyone found out where this came from we would be in trouble.” The only reason his father is still alive is because his mom promised indefinante allegence to the Chancellor of Terra Firma to save the life of the man he loved. 

His mom spoke next. “We considered withholding this gift, it is afterall just a blank book.” Jamie opened the black covered book to confirm, it was indeed blank. There wern’t any markings on the cover or spine either. A confused expression crossed Jamie’s face. His mother continued, “but after discussing it a bit. We are hoping you will finally be the bridge between our two cultures.”
 
“I doubt it.” Jamie pointed out the window. “How would I get them to stop fighting if neither group takes their orders from me?” 

“That’s the question I’ve struggled with since I became Queen. There is no good answer to that one.” She turned to leave. “I’m not sure what purpose that book will serve, but knowing the person it’s from it may eventually have that answer.” 

Jamie looked down at the book opening it again and flipping though it. All the pages were still blank. “What do you mean by that?” He looked up to see that his mother and father had already left. 

He went to his desk with the book and studied it some more. Flipping though each page they were indeed all blank. The pages felt differnt, it was almost as if they had a plastic layer around them, a lamination. However, none existed. 

He tossed the book and caught it confused by it. All of a sudden it became warm. Jamie dropped the book due to the suprise. The black spine turned a mocha color.  

He looked inside and the first page had writing on it “Hi. Please write in me.” Moments later the text disappeared. 

He sat down at his desk with a orange colored pen in hand and stared down at the pages. They had no further insight to share. 

Jamie wrote, “Who are you?” The words shimmered for a moment on the page then vanished. 

“I am a friend of your father’s. This book will help us communicate the vast physical distances between us. Just write in it and my spine will change color. Likewise the other direction.” 
“Where are you?” 

One word appeared. “Pluto.” In disbelief it vanished before his eyes after he read it. Although, it took much longer for him to process the meaning.

Jamie’s writing got sloppier as he wrote quickly “How can you really be there? No communication can go that fast. Who are you really? How are you doing this? What’s your goal? Funny prank. I’ll get my dad back later.”

“No prank.”

“How?”

“Magic... isn’t just fairy tales.”

“Why should I believe you?”

“Because your father put himself at great risk to get us this opportunity to talk.”

“I’m done.”

Just before he the book he saw the last message he would get for a while from this book. “It was nice to meet you.”

### Planum Castle - Mars

#### Media Room

Jamie sat in front of a wall of fifteen television screens arranged on a wall. All fifteen screens had different content. All of them had closed captioning on. Six TVs had a green outline and their sound was sent to one speaker each around the room. Jamie was gifted with the ability to consume multiple streams of information at once. This was how he kept himself informed; he was never allowed out of the castle.
