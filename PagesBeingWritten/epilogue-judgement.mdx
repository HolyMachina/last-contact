### President’s Unofficial Office

“There was a time when I thought I was doing the right thing.” Tim confided in his most trusted group. He sat in dark room lit by a wall with many screens. The six screens in the middle had upon them the same six figures that supported him since he became president. The remaining screens on the wall were various news broadcasts all muted. The soft armchair chair he was sitting in was behind a large desk specifically built over this chair. Allorien stood behind him creating a soft luminescence.

“You are” said Jamie.

“Each of you, except for you Allestra,” the older woman nodded “will remain in your positions after I am gone, at least for a while. Don’t defend me too much. It’s up to the people.” 

He clicked a button and one of the media screens focused and took over three of the screns near by as all the other content shifted. “Watch carefully. If I continue to be president I want her to be the new press secretary. I need each of your help assessing her. We’re going to have a lot of confusing information to get out there in a way that people can understand, so we’re looking for her to be good at explaining the complex charismatically and correctly. Oh, and most importantly she needs to put humanity as a whole above every independent human.”

### Human News Network Broadcast Studio

Seated in a broadcasters chair with a set backdrop was Dana, “Welcome to the nine o clock news segment on the Human News Network. Today we will be spending the next hour executing the first of its kind of the special election to replace President Timothy Li. Starting at five after nine you can begin casting your ballots. All humans regardless of age, ethnicity, home planet, beliefs, religion, or any other factors are eligible to vote you can report your vote directly to HELIX and you may freely change your vote as many times as you wish until 5 before the hour. Preliminary results will be released at nine fifty five. With the official tally to be calculated by 10 pm. You will be able to find your specific vote as well as anonymized votes of the rest of humanity. There will be a two hour period after records release where you may dispute your own vote and have it nullified, but not changed, if you wish. After that period, official vote results will be certified at one am UHT. It is now five past the hour, you may begin voting.” She pressed a couple of fake buttons on her desk to symbolize filing her vote officially which she did with a telepathic HELIX interface.

She then launched into the actual broadcast. “During the last couple weeks I’ve been doing a full investigation of the president and his inner circle as well as this alien that has appeared and I will be reporting all sides of what I have found. President Li, “ a picture of him appeared “as many of you know was born on November 17th 2267 in Tokyo which was at the time part of the Terra Firma Empire. He is credited with ending the war between Terra Firma and the government of Venus at time which resulted in the unification of humanity.”

“Damn straight.” Said Allestra

“However did you know that President Li has magical abilities?” Dana paused for dramatic effect.

The president laughed “oh, she’s good.”

Jaedon, who was serving as president of the earth coalition spoke up “I wonder where she got that nugget.”

“As you know magic use is still illegal in many parts of humanity. Including here on Earth where roughly fifty two percent of humanity live. I have received court documents from the third district court of Tokyo that accuse them nine year old Timothy of killing his own mother with an errant fire spell that ignited their home.” She paused again

“We’ll, that’s that.” President Li said, “that plus my confession of working with aliens really should be enough to rule me out.”

At this point two people spoke the same words at the same time. Expressing both their thoughts, the queen of Venus, Gwen, who was in the Presidents inner circle and Dana the investigative reporter both opened the door to other factors.  “But there’s so much more to the story.”
