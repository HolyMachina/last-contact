# Discord Server

Well, I made a discord server for fans. If you want to join, please do so!

[Here's the discord server](https://discord.gg/kGT7FA7fWr).

There's also a link in the nav bar!

There's also a link on the about me page.

There's also a link in the footer...

Too much?

Oh and here's the weird built in discord widget thing:
