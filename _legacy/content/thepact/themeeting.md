# The Meeting

## September 1, 2282 CE

### Terra Firma Empire

#### London

##### Caledonian Road Tube Station

Ylena stood in front of the leaders of the black-market with the most intimidating frame they had ever seen. She traded with them pretty frequently. Her business had been extracting high priced information from Terra Firma for years. She used it to fund an underground lifestyle she couldn't have afforded if she played by the rules of the government. She gave the information to the black market and they did something with it, but she never knew what... She liked it that way.

The representatives of the black market were sitting behind a large bench on an elevated stage built on top of a set of train tracks, yet she was eye level with them. The construction all looked temporary. There was a curved wall behind them that arched above them and came down behind her. Her long flowing blonde hair billowed around her. She was six feet and two inches tall; she also hid five-inch spiked heels under her custom designed black maxi dress which perfectly reached the floor with no excess. Broad shouldered and extremely threatening, she knew she had just stolen a set of documents that had had one of the highest prices in the universe and Ylena was demanding top dollar, and she needed every dollar because she would need to go into hiding for many years.

The air was stagnant, interrupted only by tense breathing. Then an ultimatum crossed the table. She said it as clear as day, although day never shined down here in the abandoned London Underground. "You promised 50 billion credits. I have acquired the full set, I demand payment." She produced two data disks from her jacket pocket. They were both labeled as having half of the required data.

A thick Russian accent shook up the air from the far left side of the table. "We never expected some of these documents would be found and even less acquired. We just sent people on the hunt trying to figure out where they were before they died. We cannot pay such an unreasonable figure. Ylena you have to be kidding us."

"Well, isn't that your fault? This is what you asked for. You advertised, I answered. At least now you know where they are. I should demand payment just for that fact alone, but I won't. Because I'm nice." She winked, placed the data disks casually back in her pocket, and turned to leave. She had stolen them directly from the source after she betrayed and ran from the Jet Setters, the Terra Firma Special Forces team she was part of.

Out of the corner of her eye she saw the black-market representatives were extremely uncomfortable. Particularly one member on the right side who squirmed slightly. As she took her first step back towards the entrance of the Caledonian Road tube station, a man yelled out to her with a French accent. "We'll put you in touch with the person who commissioned us to find them."

Pure chaos erupted at the table. There were screams of "How could you?!" "Why would you?!" and "Where's our profit in that?!" in many different accents from all around the world.

She turned back and, with a steely gaze, said, "I will pay you all one third of what they pay me." There were murmurings at the table. She paused, feeling exited they were even considering it. This could still be the biggest score of her career.

After what seemed like forever, but only because she was so excited, the one in the middle said, "Okay, it's a deal. This was a commission by the Venusian government to find this data. It sounded they expected anyone who tried to fail like we did. We were promised a compensation of 2 billion credits for the information. We still expect at least that much compensation. The contact holder is named Xavix. You can find him in a safe house at 42 Trinity Square, near the old site of the Tower of London. We will let him know you are coming." He threw a small metal ball at her, which she caught one handed. "If you can get in this object, it has the password he uses; we couldn't get in. He somehow knew we were coming anyway, so it does not matter, it seems he uses this as test. We all failed."

She looked at the metal ball then put it in her pocket. "Thank you. I will keep you posted as to my progress."

As she turned to leave the group said all in unison, "With this theft you are now the most successful thief in the history of humanity. He's going to be very interested in you. But you're going to have a huge bounty on your head."

It made her pause, smirk over her shoulder, and say "A little infamy never hurt anyone." She went up though a forgotten tunnel of stairs which opened to a trap door in a decrepit warehouse. The guards were heavily armed, but the warehouse was empty. She knew this place would not be here soon. The police will notice and Terra Firma's military will be here shortly thereafter. Black market locations never lasted but luckily, they also never get caught.

##### Streets of London

As she walked into the sunlight of an empty London afternoon it hit her again; the apocalypse had come to London. London had become disheveled. There was a constant layer of ash in the atmosphere and on the ground. Periodically there was an ashen rain from the nearly constant explosions of the neglected nuclear power facility nearby. London had fallen apart. London was toxic. London was dead. The government of Terra Firma, the planet formerly called Earth, had decided that London was worth abandoning. The Liberal sect of humanity fled the planet as conservative governments were taking over and colonized Venus. London was abandoned because there was not enough population to make the city worth maintaining. The power station was neglected shortly after and then the explosions began. The only thing the government did anymore was to find, and destroy, black market sites. Murders, rapes, violence, and theft had become very common. Ylena was strong enough to defend herself in this toxic landscape.

She considered the things she had stolen when she defected from the Jet Setters. _These are just secret legal documents about enforcement of various laws throughout Terra Firma, how could they possibly be worth this much money? I can't imagine the Venusian government would pay that much._ She knew London well. She had about an hour and fifteen-minute walk from Caledonian Road tube station to Trinity Square. Not only was there no mass transit, taxis, or cars anymore to carry her around, but there were very few people out to bother her. She shivered, despite the oppressive heat, considering the idea of defecting from the only world she had ever known. She had taken the bait when the black market asked her to steal those documents. But she also knew the only way to succeed was to burn this bridge. Was it the biggest mistake of her life?

She took out the little metal ball they gave her and noticed that it had twenty-six tiny circular buttons. The buttons had no labeling. As she walked, she clicked some of the buttons and noticed how, in some cases, multiple buttons were clicked when she pressed one. She noticed the tenth button was also clicking the seventh. The seventeenth button was activating both the eleventh and the twenty-first. And the twenty-sixth was engaging the nineteenth.

She was about halfway to her destination before she realized: it was the alphabet! The alphabet she grew up with only had twenty-three letters. She knew J, Q, & Z had been removed from the english alphabet many decades before her birth. Language had evolved in the 2100s and replaced them with other letters; which were the duplicated ones clicking at the same time. ‘The password into this thing is a word.‘ She thought, ‘Logically, what's the point of having those buttons be functional like that if they weren't used?‘ She started trying all the words she could think of with those letters. In about thirty minutes her mind was out of ideas and she put it back into her pocket.

Her mind kept racing though her vocabulary for words. She had no way to know, it could be any word in the english language. Before she knew it, she was standing in front of a door with the label "42" and nothing more. She knocked once. She knocked twice. Before she could knock a third time someone spoke from behind the door "What occurs when people put selfishness aside?"

Her jaw dropped. She had no idea what that meant. What kind of greeting was that? ‘I know this is black market trading, but still.' She paused slightly and replied "I am a friend. My name is Ylena."

A panel in the door slid aside to show a pair of eyes. Those eyes had to adjust themselves higher to meet hers. The eyes responded with recognition, "Oh, I heard you were coming," and there was a click at the door as it opened, "come in."

##### 42 Trinity Square

As she walked in, it was a cluttered space. On the walls were bookshelves of mechanical toys. There were tables covered with all kinds of documents, records, and tools. She took the sphere out of her pocket and inquired, "did you make this?"

He motioned to all the equipment on the walls and tables and said, "it is a bit of a hobby." Xavix was tall, although shorter than her, and had an athletic build. His shining, childlike blue eyes contrasted his brown hair. He then asked her, "how did you come by this?"

"The black market gave it to me. They said they couldn't figure it out. So far, I have worked out that these buttons stand for letters of the English alphabet as of the 21st century. Also, it is highly likely that the word has the letters J, Q, or Z. However, I have yet to figure out what word the password is."

"Then I propose again to you this question: What occurs when people put selfishness aside?" He stood up abruptly and walked to the kitchen. "I'm going to make some tea. Keep at it, it should be all you need."

She thought for a moment, then eyes lit up and she moved to action. She clicked in the letters one by one. E-Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y. The device clicked open and she pulled it apart from a crack in the middle. It opened to reveal a pin, but not an ordinary pin. Across the top of the pin was a steel ribbon which had inscribed the words "BE PREPARED". Coming down from that, there was a cotton ribbon dyed in red, white and blue. Hanging below that, there was a metal eagle with the letters "B S A." Ylena knew of this item: it was the emblem of a group of people called Eagle Scouts. In 2124, the Boy Scouts of America disbanded. In the same year, the last class of Eagle Scouts received that rank to that status. She heard the tea kettle and that returned her to reality. She did not know how to even bring up something of this size.

"I think this belongs to you." She said while she held it up as he reentered the room. It was the best she could do.

"No, it belonged to my great, great, great, great grandmother." He took the medal back from her mournfully. "I haven't seen the medal since I put it into this container fifteen years ago. Her name was Edith."

"Nobody has opened the box in fifteen years?"

"That is correct; it means you are exceptional. The last person I offered this to may have had a future in special operations but did not have the problem-solving ability. He decided to go into the black market instead; he is the one that gave you that box and put you in the chair where you sit now. He placed you in front of me and now you have a decision to make."

She squirmed slightly. Her frame was still quite intimidating despite her actions. "What do you mean?"

He took a sip of his tea. He calmly sat back in the comfortable chair. "My name is Jaedon Beyar. You bring to me more than the information I was looking for, you bring to me the data I wanted to acquire by bringing in a special operations team of twenty-five people." He had another sip of tea and paused.

Jaedon even began to offer her a biscuit before she got a little impatient and asked, "So, what are you saying?"

"I'm saying I want to change your life overnight. If you have what I think you have, you may have just started the ending of the war between Terra Firma, the home you know, and Venus, the planet from which I come. Have some tea, let me get some things."

As she looked around, she found him even more odd. She knew people from Venus were evil heretics. They were crazy people who wanted to take away rights and freedom. They believe in governmental control of all sides: of money, of trade, and of economic choice. Yet, this man, albeit connected with the black market, appeared to believe in equality and setting aside selfish desires to better the world? She finally decided to take a sip of tea. As she did, he walked back in with a small briefcase like device and two file folders.

He placed the file folders on the table between them. "I have two options for you: The first is that we pay you seventy-five billion credits," her eyes nearly jumped out of her skull, Jaedon paused. He smirked, before continuing "for each disk of half the data. In addition to that, we will compensate the black market a total of fifteen billion credits for their cooperation. You provide me both disks and we part ways: you return to your life as a wonderful thief and special operations officer." he pointed to the left folder. "The details are in there."

"Optionally, we pay you nothing for the disks and you join us as a special operations agent for our government. We will create a new identity for you and change your physical appearance as you wish, if you wish. We will also give you a home and comfort for the rest of your life. You would probably become the most talented agent in our history. We would provide the black market the same compensation as with the other plan." He pointed to the right folder, "As you can guess that folder contains those details. However, I will need to know your past, which you have kept very well hidden. We can't even find your real name."

She was desperate to leave this lifestyle, one choice presented her complete freedom from the lifestyle just by retiring. The other choice presented a whole new life, but also a lifetime of servitude. It even presented a new body. She felt like she could not lose, but it was a tough choice. Picking up the folders, she started reading though all the documents. He calmly ate biscuits and drank tea. He was slouching and breathing normally, but she was sitting fully upright and breathing frantically.

"Okay, I'm in." She handed him the folder that gave her a new life, and set the money aside. "My former name is not a "real" name: it's a dead name. My real name is the name you know."

"Oh, thank you for the information. That tells me all I need to know about your past. Thank you. First thing's first. I need you to steal a scientist that wants to defect, his research, and two more data disks, from the Impulse Tower in New York. Then you will be leaving this planet."
