            <h4>Pluto Orbit - Descending Toward Nova</h4>
            <h5>Senator Pace's Office Balcony</h5>
            <p>Tim, Allorien, and Senator Pace stood on a balcony enclosed in the front of the the space craft. The only personal belongings with them was a messenger bag Senator Pace had with him. As they looked out the panorama window, they looked down at a pink circular object. "Ah, finally home. It's been a long trip," Pace sighed deeply clearly happy to be returning.</p>
            <p>Pace laughed loudly. "I'm sorry nobody told you. Those," he pointed down toward the pink object, "are the Polymer Twins." In near-Pluto orbit, two concentric circles of polymer were constructed in a successful effort to make the small planet habitable. Inside the smaller bubble was a pressurized breathable atmosphere. Outside the larger bubble was, of course, space. As they got closer, they saw a small section of the outer twin opening. In between the two thin skins around Pluto were everything that kept the planet habitable for humanity.</p>
            <p>The ship moved into the a gap in the outer bubble. It was a small ship, but it just barely fit into the gap. The spacecraft was red and trimmed in gold. It looked almost like it was designed like a building. "This is the largest ship that can be accepted onto the planet Pluto." As the ship came to a stop between the two layers of Polymer, the ship turned so that it was facing what appeared to be an office built into the side with large windows. Those windows were circled by a series of red lights. A few moments later the opening above them started to close.</p>
            <p>Once the opening was fully closed, the lights around the office space started changing from red to green one by one. When they all turned green, the panorama windows on the space ship opened quickly. They were now inside the atmosphere. Tim was surprised that they had succeeded in making a spacecraft sized airlock. The panel below them in the smaller of the Polymer Twins began to open. The green lights around the office area started blinking.</p>
            <p>The ship started to tilt around so that the panel of the smaller twin was now in front of them and they were facing the surface of Pluto. As the panel opened a large city came into view below. "That," Senator Pace smiled broadly at Tim, "is the capital city of Pluto, Nova. It is also my home, where I was born and raised." After about twenty minutes, a series of lights turned on green around the panel which had opened. The ship slowly proceeded out of the Polymer Twins.</p>
            <p>As Tim looked down at the large city. In fact it appeared that the entire planet was covered in a single  city. As the ship leveled out, it was clear that the brightness was artificial. Allorien asked "Where does the light come from?"</p>
            <p>Senator Pace pointed back up toward the Polymer Twins. "There is machinery between the Polymer Twins which creates electricity as they rotate around the planet. The panels are not always aligned. Usually there is a four to five hour window where all ships must come and leave for the day. In an emergency, the panels can be aligned by moving the twins but most of the time they are left to orbit loosely within Pluto's small gravity. That movement back and forth, closer and further, generates electricity. Think of it as static electricity charged to a planetary scale. That electricity is used to make the inner twin luminescent and is used to light the entire planet at once. We keep day night cycles in line with Venus' capitol of Avalon. Suffice to say our light, our sun, is false."</p>
            <p>Allorien leaned over the railing to get a better look upwards, toward the inner Polymer sphere protecting the planet. The light radiating off was extremely bright to an average human. It was nothing to him as his home was much brighter. As he leaned further over the railing, he slipped and fell over. While the weak gravity did not pull him away quickly, it did pull him away from the ship.</p>
            <p>It pulled him away enough that nobody reacted fast enough and he started falling toward the large city. He pulled a pen like object out of his robe and threw it down from him. It quickly grew in size. It was his space ship. He fell into the cockpit without much trouble and flew back to the balcony where Tim and Senator Pace were standing. He walked out of his ship and stepped back onto the balcony.</p>
            <p>"You have all kinds of tricks up your sleeve," Senator Pace managed to say even though his jaw was dangling.</p>
            <p>Allorien responded very in a very calm manner. "We all find ways to survive some of the most difficult moments. My ship has been there for me for many years. I can't imagine being without him. You colonized a planet by encasing it in an airtight set of polymer skins. We created space ships that can enlarge and shrink so that we are never far from it." Allorien waved his hand and the large ship, which was now floating in front of Senator Pace's ship, became smaller and smaller until it was the size of a pen again and Allorien placed it back in the breast pocket of his robes.</p>
            <p>They flew in silence, nobody knowing what to say after that, straight toward the largest building on the horizon. The building was roughly 300 meters tall and two square blocks either direction at ground level. It was primarily red with yellow and gold structures and trimming. The roof was designed as a landing pad specifically for the ship in which they were traveling. As they set down on top of the building, the ship fit perfectly with all the architectural nuances and colors of the building itself. It was clear the two had been designed together. There was a large mechanical set of sounds as the ship set itself on top of the building.</p>
            <p>"What's going on?" Tim asked.</p>
            <p>"My ship is the top floor of this building. This building is the central government office of Pluto and this ship is specifically for its Senator's usage." Senator Pace explained. "The sounds you hear now is the ship reintegrating itself with the building systems so that it doesn't have to run its own engine." He paused for a second and added "The engines should turn off... now." Just as he said that, the humming that was present though the structure ceased, and, a couple more mechanical clanks later, there was pure silence.</p>
            <p>"Oh, you never notice how much sound you're around until it's gone."</p>
            <p>"Exactly." Senator Pace said as he turned to lead them off the balcony and through the office. Tim and Allorien followed through to the lower levels of the ship and it confused the two of them because it appeared as if they had reconfigured themselves. It appeared more like an office building than a spaceship. The bottom layer of the spacecraft was now the top floor in the building. They moved quickly off the ship. Tim was looking everywhere curious of the details, the ornate inlays and gaudy overdone accents grabbed at his overly open eyes.</p>
            <p>Senator Pace laughed, "we designed the building to provoke exactly that reaction. Thank you for obliging us." Tim blushed, feeling admonished by the comment. Allorien's eyes twinkled slightly noticing the subtle mental playfulness.</p>
            <p>A moment later, they turned right into a door labeled "The Multi-Purpose Room". It was a drab room compared to the ornate nature of the rest of the political center of Pluto. The room itself was exceptionally large but, in the center, there was a small circular table with only three chairs. Allorien, observant and adept in the ways of mental subtext, commented on the state of the room. "It doesn't seem this room is very 'multi-purpose' as stated on the door."</p>
            <p>Senator Pace lead them back out of the room and took small electronic device from inside his shoulder bag. As he closed the door to the room, he fiddled with the device, clicking a few buttons on it. A whirring sound came from inside the multi-purpose room before he lead them back inside. The room now had a full size stage and 150 plush reclining chairs forming an audience. Allorien was taken aback by this trick, his jaw gaping. As they stepped back outside, Tim was the first to speak. "I never could have imagined any of this was possible."</p>
            <p>Senator Pace clicked a few buttons on the device after the door closed and the room made a tornado like sound again. He commented, "You never know what's possible until you open your eyes. Open eyes and ears gather other people's ideas and take them to your mind. There, they mutate and form new ideas. This is how all innovation happens."</p>
            <p>They walked back into the large room and it was setup again for the three of them to have a private conversation. As they sat down, Senator Pace got straight to the point looking directly at Allorien, "Why would a species of beings such as yourself be interested in Humanity?"</p>
            <p>Allorien didn't skip a beat answering, "because my species created your species."</p>
