            <h3>April 3, 2271 C.E.</h3>
            <h4>Terra Firma - New York City</h4>
            <h5>East 55th Street</h5>
            <p>It was a rainy night in New York City. The city only slept when it was told to. As she walked down east 55th street, she knew the world would never see her. She was invisible to the world. The world assumed things and prevented a sense of self. Alestra Amalee was walking northeast with a bunch of other people. As she turned the corner onto Madison Avenue, a car turned the opposite direction and kicked water up and all over her. She took her coat off. It was cold tonight, but at least the rain hadn't gotten though it yet. Her hair was short, almost military in style, she was a large woman and many people mistook her for a man. Well, to them, she was. As she shook off her leather coat and continued walking Northwest on Madison Avenue, she briefly pushed past a couple people. She knew her goals. Turning left on fifth avenue, she knew there was only one place she could get what she needed. Walking the last block, she knew it was either do this or well, she didn't know what.</p>

            <h4>Impulse Tower</h4>
            <h5>Exterior</h5>
            <p>The tower used to belong to an important american family. It had different lettering, it had a different facade, but she knew the history. This tower used to belong to the Trump family. Some people credited the family with ruining the country, some others credited the family with saving the country. She knew there was more to it than that, because there was more to her than that. The current occupant of the penthouse suite wasn't related to the family, but that was because the penthouse was now the home of the Chancellor of the Terra Firma Empire. She'd made this run multiple times before, and it was starting to pay off in real ways. What she didn't know was how much longer till her luck ran out.</p>
            <p>From the street, she looked up at the tower before she snuck down a side alley. She turned around to make sure nobody was following her, then climbed a fire escape. Reaching the third floor, there was a garbage chute that emptied into a dumpster below but it was her best way in. She wasn't beyond crawling though a garbage chute.</p>

            <h5>Third Floor Controlled Substances Pharmacy</h5>
            <p>Alestra poked her head out of the chute. The chute, large enough for trash bags, opened at the back of the pharmacy. <i>Always just a little ironic isn't it,</i> she thought to herself. The lights were off and nobody was around. As she climbed out, covered in the residue of the chute, she had a mission. First and foremost, she looked around and found that she was locked in. <i>Okay, cool.</i> She started looking though the shelves of bottles. They had reorganized them. Alphabetical. <i>Fuck.</i> They used to be together. She quickly moved over to the "S" bottles and took a couple off the shelf. She always stole six month supplies at the least. Then, she moved over to the "E" area and threw a couple more bottles in her messenger bag. At that point, an alarm started blaring throughout the area. <i>Shit. Maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought.</i> She closed her bag and sprinted back to the garbage chute to find it closed and locked. <i>Well, what now.</i></p>
            <p>"This way." She heard a voice behind her and turned around. A young girl with dark purple hair stood in front of her and right in front of a door hidden behind a false wall. Alestra paused. "Well, come on," the girl said again. Alestra looked back behind her.</p>
            <p>There was a scoff. "It's the police or me. Take your pick."</p>
            <p>"How do I know I can trust you?" Alestra asked.</p>
            <p>"Really?" The girl responded sarcastically. She was only in her early teens but clearly had tricks up her sleeve. "You don't. But anyone that steals from my dad is okay in my book. Now, come on."</p>
            <p>As Alestra and the young girl disappeared though the hidden door, they heard the boots of the police coming dangerously close to where they were. Alestra sighed deeply and looked up and down. There was a column of "empty space" hidden, leading up and down throughout the tower. The bottom three floors were highlighted in red and the red was going up the tower one by one as other floors were alerted to the thief's presence. Somehow this girl had made it her home, it was decorated with various plants, paint designs, and furniture throughout. Each floor had what was effectively a balcony with a set of stairs that lead to the next balcony.</p>
            <p>The girl held out her hand "Nice to meet you, I'm Cassandra."</p>
            <p>"You can..."</p>
            <p>"Get anywhere in the tower very quickly? Yes. You're the dude the reports are about. Orlen?"</p>
            <p>"Yes and no, but mostly no."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
            <p>"That's a long story."</p>
            <p>Cassandra was a gracious host, "well then, let's talk. I think we can benefit from each other" and she motioned up the set of stairs.</p>
            <p>Alestra started walking up flight after flight with Cassandra directly behind her. Each flight had a TV screen showing showing a security camera image that would identify if there would be anyone to see if the secret door opened. They walked in silence, Alestra didn't know what she had gotten herself into. Alestra knew the next couple hours would be pretty critical to her future.</p>

            <h5>53rd Floor</h5>
            <p>As they reached the 53rd floor, there were no more stairs up and the pathway led to a door. Alestra stepped aside. Cassandra opened the door and they stepped though. Closing the door behind them, the door vanished into what was a wall that Cassandra had painted. "How many people know you have this column of space throughout the entire building?" Alestra asked.</p>
            <p>"Oh, just me, the architect, and the construction team that did it for me. Well, and now you. My dad told them they had to make whatever modifications to the building I wanted, this is what I wanted."</p>
            <p>Looking around Alestra saw a completely empty 16 foot floor. All the way around were full height windows. There was a consistent even lighting glowing from the ceiling and the floor. Though most of the area you could see from windows to windows as if nothing was constructed in the floor at all. Power and data connections were in the floor every hundred feet or so. Sporadically across the floor space, there were ten foot tall temporary mobile walls that formed little rooms. There were just three interruptions in the otherwise uninterrupted floor space: two full height columns and one half height block. All three were heavily painted. Well I know what this one is but what are the other two.</p>
            <p>Cassandra pointed to the other full height column and said "that's the penthouse elevator shaft" she then turned and pointed to the half hight block and said "that's the mechanical room for the elevators for normal people" Cassandra started walking toward the penthouse elevator shaft sighed and said "apparently some things can't be moved no matter how much I want them to be. And my dad had to come see me somehow." She opened another hidden door and it showed the golden doors to the elevator. "Any wonder why I wanted that covered up? I think I'm gonna have them rebuild the floor into a giant maze at some point and I'll just live in one of the corners or next to my column."</p>
            <p>"It's a cool place. So, why are you interested in me?" Alestra asked as Cassandra started leading her across the floor, toward one of the temporary rooms setup against the windows.</p>
            <p>"Well, I saw the reports of someone stealing from the controlled substances pharmacy for about two years now, with a predictable timing but never getting caught. You're good." They walked past a room that had a significant amount of technology plugged into a couple of the data ports on the floor.</p>
            <p>"Oh, they've been on to me that long?"</p>
            <p>"Yep."</p>
            <p>"Wow, they really suck." The little room they entered had a couple of floor chairs and a low table.</p>
            <p>"Yep. They do. I only ran across the report a couple days ago. Your predictability was well... a problem." They each took a chair.</p>
            <p>"You know, you're very," Alestra started with what she would think would be a compliment but Cassandra interrupted her. "Do not dare tell me I'm mature for my age. I hear it all. The. Time."</p>
            <p>"So, what's your interest in me?"</p>
            <p>"I need access to things that people won't give me willingly. I thought we could work together."</p>
            <p>"And what do I get for this deal with the devil?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, don't confuse me with the government my father runs. I do know you only target the government when you steal, I just don't know why."</p>
            <p>"Question still stands." Alestra shifted uncomfortably as she challenged Cassandra.</p>
            <p>"You live here instead of on the street, an infinite quantity of what you're stealing, we make the existence you seek legal despite my father, and you get the career you want as a Jet Setter."</p>
            <p>"The special operations military force?" Alestra was incredulous. They're super hard to get into, most of the orphans how get in need to know someone."</p>
            <p>"The same." Cassandra picked up the drink from the table and sipped it. "You know someone now. And, I have a feeling you'll be the best they've ever seen."</p>
            <p>"And the catch?"</p>
            <p>"Well, getting you out of the life you're in now and into the new life won't be super easy. All I ask is that you steal things for me periodically that I don't want on record."</p>
            <p>"What are you, 13? How do you have this much bargaining power?"</p>
            <p>"Well, I am the daughter of the Chancellor of Terra Firma. And, I have a fake identity that makes money in addition to what I get just because of who I am."</p>
            <p>Alestra shifted uncomfortably. "That raised more questions than it answered."</p>
            <p>"We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, we just have to do the ugly part first." Cassandra smirked.</p>
            <p>"Ugly part?" Alestra shifted uncomfortably.</p>
            <p>"Come with me." Cassandra stood up and Alestra followed. Passing a different room, Alestra saw a computer terminal connected to the floor. It was displaying a black screen with green text and had a panel on it that had a red, green, and yellow button. The yellow button was alit. "What's th-"</p>
            <p>Before she could finish what she was saying, they were at a different temporary room that was full of storage bins, all of which were fully on wheels. Cassandra opened one and started digging though it, throwing random objects all over the room. "Ah! Here it is" Cassandra pulled out a small capsule sized device. "This will allow us to communicate."</p>
            <p>"Okay..." Alestra trailed off waiting for her to say more.</p>
            <p>Instead Cassandra lead her back to the door that lead to the hidden column of space build up and down throughout the building. She opened the door for Alestra. "You have two options. One. Go all the way down to the ground floor, there's an exit that will let you escape. Or, Two. Go down to any floor. Go out, get yourself arrested. From there, I will arrange for it to look like you died in custody where, instead, you are covertly released and you can come back here."</p>
            <p>As Alestra was processing the options the door closed on her face. She heard it lock.</p>
