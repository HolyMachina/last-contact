            <h3>April 5, 2112 C.E.</h3>
            <h4>Bunker under the Sahara Desert</h4>
            <h5>Encampment 42</h5>
            <p>Allorien stood with a younger member of his species inside the command center of a bunker. <i>Fae, this is a critical moment for humanity, and we will have to report on it, so pay attention.</i></p>
            <p>In one of many encampments under the Sahara Desert, a group of people watched television. Built under the former border of Libya and Egypt, these encampments had been used to hide nearly one third of the human population during a purge of people who disagreed with the political order which was coming to power.</p>
            <p>People of diverse backgrounds watched, but closest to the television was a grey-haired woman in a formal dress. She stood, her full attention to the television as the talking head on the television said, "We have just elected Donald John Trump the Fifth as the president of the United Nations of America. In his core campaign promise, he vows to bring the stability of a consistent leadership beyond the United Nations of America to the entire world!"</p>
            <p>Dolorès Le'rue sighed deeply and spoke in a thick French accent. "Well, that's it. There's no hope left for the concept of democracy on this planet. It won't be long before this planet is one big dictatorship. It's time to leave." While everyone around the world had begun speaking the same language, many accents and dialects remained in the new language of Canon. Only a few languages had truly died, each state within the four major nations of the world kept their languages too. Most of the world was at least bilingual at this point.</p>
            <p>She turned around and addressed the other people in the room, "Forty five years after we started building these encampments," she waved at the metal walls around her, "they will serve the purpose for which they were created. As many of you know," she nodded to a couple of people in the group, who nodded back. She took a digital pen and looked at the whiteboard under the TV. Things were already scrawled on it "let's do this" and "is it real?" all of these messages were not in the middle of the board, but not around the edges either. She looked at the board and then stared at it, waiting. Encampment One was responsible for the first decision. Then in the top-left corner, the word "ready" appeared. Over time, around the edges of the whiteboard, the word "ready" appeared in various handwritings forty-one times, sequentially and clockwise around the edge of the board.</p>
            <p>She walked up to the board, took the large pen looking object off the top of the board. Above the last "ready" and below the first one, near the upper-left corner of the board, she wrote "Yes, it's real." She took another deep breath and then, using a Japanese script, she wrote five large symbols in the middle of the board. She read them in Canon as she wrote them, "Launch immediately."</p>
            <p>"Yes ma'am." The group of people around her all headed in different directions and to control consoles, and a hum of energy started reverberating though the structure. As the hum got louder, the whole structure around them started reverberating and shaking.</p>
            <p>The news broadcast they were watching shifted tone quickly, "We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news alert!" All the eyes and ears in the room focused back onto the TV. "The Earth Geological Survey is detecting multiple severe earthquakes under the Sahara Desert. We are working on getting some satellite imagery from the area." Dolorès was the first to speak. "Well, the cat's out of the bag. We either succeed or we are all arrested and killed. Let's do it."</p>
            <p>There was a loud bang and the entire structure shook heavily. Everyone looked back to their panels and displays.</p>
            <p>"That was engine number 12. It exploded, it's completely offline." A woman looked up from her panel on the other end of the room. "Sixteen of the twenty engines are online. We'll be slow, but it will be enough."</p>
            <p>Dolorès spoke, "Well, good for us, I guess. What about the rest of the fleet?"</p>
            <p>Another voice struck out, "Crafts number twenty-nine, thirty, and forty-one do not have enough engines online for liftoff. At this point, they will be stranded. We already lost number twenty-eight in construction."</p>
            <p>"Which has the most engines online?"</p>
            <p>"Thirty, they're only short by one. They will probably make it."</p>
            <p>"We can't lose three more ships; that's too many people. Get me their one main voice circuits all at once."</p>
            <p>Another officer standing at a desk named FCOM said, "Yes, Ma'am." A minute's pause went by. "We have 1MC for twenty-nine, thirty forty-one and forty-two"</p>
            <p>Dolorès took the ship microphone off the wall and clicked a button, then spoke. "All crew of craft forty-one, abandon ship to craft forty-two. All crew of craft twenty-nine, abandon ship to craft thirty-six." She then hung up the receiver and sighed deeply. Looking around the room at her officers, she saw the resolve reflecting in their eyes. The entire group shared a wordless feeling. They were prepared to wait, they would rather not leave anyone behind.</p>
            <p>Dolorès' Attention turned back to the news broadcast, "The sands of the Sahara are shifting!" She looked back at the TV as the rest of her officers went back to their controls. "Look at these dramatic pictures, it looks more like an ocean than a desert!" The satellite imagery from the news broadcast now showed sand shifting up and down as if waves were moving through the Sahara. Sand began to settle and large deep caverns formed. "Wait, is that metal? It appears that metal is protruding out from the sands of the Sahara." The shifting Sahara desert had now revealed forty-two metal structures, each three miles long and one mile wide. Laid out in a rectangle, they were connected by a tunnel system. Each metal structure was emblazoned with a large number, from one to forty-two. The talking head only had questions. "What are those? Are they buildings? Why are they shaking?"</p>
            <p>Craft number four was first. It took to the air, lifting straight off the structure on which it was situated. "They're not buildings they're planes?!" Twenty blue light rocket engines fired on the back of the building, and it started to move forward. "It's a plane! There are forty-two planes under the Sahara desert!" Other metal structures started to lift off and launch as craft four turned itself straight up toward the satellite and began to draw closer. Another satellite camera could see that number four was angled out of the atmosphere and headed straight to space.  "No! They're leaving the planet! Those are spaceships!" Moments later, craft nine turned and aligned with this satellite. As each new satellite camera shot appeared, one of the crafts taking up from the Sahara desert aligned with it. Dolorès smiled deeply, her eyes sparkled. <i>The plan is working.</i> she thought to herself.</p>
            <p>"Officers of the deck. Give me a go, no go for launch." Dolorès commanded.</p>
            <p>The officer who was standing at a console labeled <abbr title="Fleet Communication and Operations Manager">FCOM</abbr> started the conversation. "<abbr title="Instrumentation and Communications Officer">INCO</abbr>"</p>
            <p>The officer standing behind the <abbr title="Instrumentation and Communications Officer">INCO</abbr> desk said, "Go"</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="FCOM">Fleet Communication and Operations Manager</abbr> continued the conversation, "<abbr title="Field Integrated Design and Operations">FIDO</abbr>"</p>
            <p>"Go"</p>
            <p>"<abbr title="Electrical, Environmental, and Communications">EECOM</abbr>"</p>
            <p>Dolorès zoned out as her officers did their job. She thought about the history making decision they had all made together. To think that one third of Humanity leaving the planet to go colonize another planet was groundbreaking itself, the fact that they were doing it to flee from persecution made her feel like crying. Even after all this time, Humanity still had refugees.</p>
            <p>"Captain! Captain Dolorès." her fleet communication officer was trying to grab her attention.</p>
            <p>"Oh. I'm sorry."</p>
            <p>"All systems go."</p>
            <p>"Thank you. <abbr title="1 Main Channel (the all hands PA channel on a ship)">1MC</abbr>." There was an audio click, and Dolorès picked up a microphone and clicked the button. "All hands, this is the captain. We are ready to lift off, some of our fellows already launched, but three ships were stranded. We will be delaying our launch slightly to receive members of another craft which was stranded. Furthermore, we will receive them, and then we will be on our way… to Venus."</p>
            <p>Allorien, standing beside Dolorès, muttered to themselves and Fae telepathically <i>Separating Humanity into two distinct groups, how will they work together now? They should stay together and arbitrate their differences here. It would be quicker. They only have a little under two hundred years left.</i></p>
            <p>Fae responded telepathically from where he stood beside the fleet communications officer, <i>Can't we help guide them?</i></p>
            <p><i>Remember the oath you took? We cannot, under any circumstances, be the source of any knowledge they receive. It breaks them. And we need them whole, to fight for us.</i></p>
            <p>They were escaping from the only planet they had ever known. There were thousands of humans aboard this ship just trying to escape and get themselves freedom from a tyrannical world government. If only they knew who was there with them. They could have asked for help, and the Crysix would have given it. However, the humans on the bridge of this ship had no idea the two aliens had been here the whole time...</p>
