            <h3>October 29, 2019 C.E.</h3>
            <h4>Yuntianxiang, Hunan, China</h4>
            <p>Allorien stood in a field just outside of town, to the east. They could see the lights of Zhuzhou Fangte Happy World through the twilight. The muted sounds of the amusement park barely reached their ears. They knew that they were about to change the course of Humanity.</p>
            <p>They walked across the field, pondering if they were ready and willing to do it. There was going to be a lot of collateral damage to Humanity, but maybe they would unite against this common foe. They took one last look at the lights of the theme park on the horizon; it would soon close. Not for the night, but for a long time.</p>
            <p>He looked down as he entered into the mouth of a large cave while hundreds of small bats were exiting the cave. They sensed the energies of Allorien, even if humans couldn't. As he walked into the cave, he placed an invisible barrier of energy so that no more bats could pass through. He stood in the cave and held out his hands palms up open wide.</p>
            <p>There was a long moment. They didn't know if they were ready; they had to do something. So they did it. Various insects started materializing and crawling out of Allorien's hand and into the cave.</p>
            <p>The bats were hungry. The normal process of life and death continued around them. They turned around. There's no turning back now. As Allorien walked out of the cave, he dropped the energy barrier and swarms of bats flew in and out. They took a couple of steps out and looked to the horizon. It was dark now, the glow of the Happy World was still prevalent. They stood there for a moment.</p>
            <p>"So, what did you do? Moreover, why did you do it? I know what you put in motion." Sai's voice intruded on their mind. Allorien turned around to see her standing at the mouth of the cave. "You've violated my request."</p>
            <p>"It will force people to work together."</p>
            <p>Sai scoffed. "Like the last time they experienced an major epidemic? You're a student of human history. Tell me what happened."</p>
            <p>"They blamed it on the people most affected, and demonized the sick instead of helping them."</p>
            <p>"What makes you think that won't happen again?"</p>
            <p>"They've grown since AIDS." Allorien responded.</p>
            <p>"They haven't grown enough. Good luck. You know, I'm retiring. Clearly you're going to make the same mistakes I did. They're your species now." Sai responded. She scoffed at Allorien, then walked off.</p>
