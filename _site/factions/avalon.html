            <h3>October 29, 2285 C.E.</h3>
            <h4>Venus Orbit</h4>
            <h5>Edith - Bridge</h5>
            <p>With Jaedon in pilot seat, Alestra in the co-pilot seat and Sam and Tim in the passenger seats of the cockpit, they were all strapped in very tightly. Allorien was standing behind Sam and Tim. It was clear it would not be a soft landing. Jaedon was the first to break the silence. "We are going to be approaching the planet at speeds near the capabilities of this ship, the shield should just barely hold. The reason for this entry to the contaminated side of Venus is that the Senate is not expecting us for a couple more days, they would know something is up if we come early."</p>
            <p>Edith dropped from upper orbit on the uninhabited side of Venus. As the ship twisted around between objects in low orbit of Venus everyone got moved around in their seats. Allorien did not move, standing behind Sam and Tim. Jaedon had memorized a chart of all known Venusian satellites and expertly guided Edith away from them at great speed. Tim was the first to say anything "You are quite good at this."</p>
            <p>Jaedon smirked, "This is not the first time I have come to this planet discreetly."</p>
            <p>One of the control panels turned red and a high-pitched sound echoed throughout the hull. Everyone looked up to the navigation screen which displayed a collision warning. "Edith, show it to me."</p>
            <p>On the screen popped up a satellite that Jaedon had never seen before. He thought aloud in stressful situations. "A new satellite? Is there an emblem? Zoom in!" The camera magnified to show the symbol of the Terra Firma News Agency. "Edith, what can we do?"</p>
            <p>The Artificial Intelligence of the ship responded, "Very little, there is not enough time to engage weaponry, and it has too much mass to ram safely. We are moving too fast to adjust course meaningfully before impact"</p>
            <p>Allorien spoke up from the rear of the cockpit. "Go ahead and ram it."</p>
            <p>Edith spoke up. "There is no physical way that would result safely."</p>
            <p>Jaedon turned to Allorien, "Are you sure?"</p>
            <p>Allorien nodded, and then closed his eyes. He sat down on the floor. Allorien said something quietly that none of them understood. As they were about to hit the satellite, it gracefully moved around the ship and perfectly resumed its normal orbit. Four jaws dropped to the floor.</p>
            <p>It took Jaedon a moment to recover. "Okay, Edith, shields up for entry to Venus West."</p>
            <p>"No more tricks from the alien?" Edith responded sarcastically.</p>
            <p>"Edith, we've talked about this, everyone has different gifts. We need to respect those." He turned to Allorien, "I'm sorry, she gets very stubborn about things she doesn't understand. Although, like her, I am curious as to what you did. I guess curiosity runs in the family."</p>
            <p>Ylena looked back to Jaedon, "She's your family? That's her Eagle Scout badge isn't it? That explains why she keeps calling me ma'am."</p>
            <p>Each person on the ship felt the computer roll its proverbial eyes. "Yeah, I wish my descendent would stop telling me to stop. It's a sign of respect from one transgender woman to another."</p>
            <p>Jaedon lost his cool, "Stop it!"</p>
            <p>Edith responded, "So I should just get back to the work of controlling a space ship, yes?"</p>
            <p>A sigh came with one simple word, "Yes."</p>
            <p>Edith engaged the shields to prepare for entry causing the rainbow paint to melt off the ship and expose a gleaming silver. These shields were designed specifically for the acidic clouds of Venus and forced the paint of the ship to melt away into space. After a couple of moments, once all the paint had melted off the shields shifted and encased the ship in a green glow.</p>
            <p>As they hit the atmosphere of Venus, the ship buffeted uncontrollably. Jaedon kept an eye on the shields, which quickly went down to ninety-two percent. The shield was clicking down too fast, they would never reach the ground. Everyone's eyes seemed locked on that. "Edith, why are the shields so low already?"</p>
            <p>"Your piloting my dear, we are entering the atmosphere at the wrong angle."</p>
            <p>Jaedon responded with a "What?"</p>
            <p>"I got it," Alestra took the controls and tapped them slightly. The shield started going down significantly more slowly. "We should be fine now."</p>
            <p>"Confirmed. The shields should now hold all the way through the clouds. This is why most people don't come into Venus from the western hemisphere" Edith responded.</p>
            <p>"I was never good with the delicate details." Jaedon remarked.</p>
            <p>"That's why women exist." Alestra giggled, trafficking on old inaccurate stereotypes as a joke.</p>
            <p>A yellow collision warning came up and Jaedon pulled up hard. The shields started depreciating quickly again. The two of them both wrestled the craft together around the unidentified object and then slowly back to course. "What was that?" Jaedon asked after a moment.</p>
            <p>The ship tore back down though the clouds constantly accelerating at an unreasonable angle and the shield started dropping quickly again. When it got to twenty percent, Sam and Tim both raised their concerns. Worried.</p>
            <p>"Don't worry we'll be breaking though any moment." Jaedon said. The ship flew out of the side of an orange red cloud wall, streaking clouds behind it into decontaminated and breathable air.</p>
            <p>Orange and yellow clouds covered the visual screens behind them while a large castle was directly in-front of them. They were still headed toward the ground. Another red 'impact warning' appeared on the screen. Allorien found the situational footing first, "Do I need to do something about this?"</p>
            <p>"Not this time, my friend."</p>
            <p>A section of ground opened to reveal a hidden landing ramp which lead into a large, ornate, landing bay. As the ship landed the section of ground closed quickly behind them. There would be little evidence that anything happened here. The ship's external camera focused on a man in blue robes, a boy in red robes, and a young woman in a white dress wearing a tiara and smiling sincerely. Sam's eyes lit up with the recognition of someone he missed dearly.</p>
            <p>Alestra was the first for situational footing this time, "Welcome to the home of the royal family of Venus."</p>
            <p>They all looked at Allorien. Allorien looked around and said "Don't worry I won't reveal myself until you introduce me."</p>

            <h4>Avalon Castle</h4>
            <h5>Secret Landing Bay</h5>
            <p>Gwen smiled broadly as Sam, Tim, and Mr. Beyar came down the stairs from Edith. There was also one tall woman coming with them that she didn't know. Her tiara sparkled in the bright lighting of the landing bay. She moved forward but was held back by her father. "Dear, you are royalty, you should patiently wait for them to come to you. Don't let your excitement to see them show too much, it will make negotiations difficult later in your life if your emotions show though too much." She paused. They walked toward her slowly, everyone following Jaedon. He was the only one that had been here before, the rest were lost in how a hidden landing pad could be so ornate.</p>
            <p>"Dad, while I understand your concern, these are my friends. I am not negotiating with anyone here."</p>
            <p>"Okay good point, but you never know what your future will hold, and it's good to always be in practice. With that said, go ahead."</p>
            <p>She smiled broadly at him and ran forward. Her dress fluttered in the recirculated air. It wasn't long before she covered the distance and hugged both Sam and Tim at the same time. "I'm so glad you got out. I've missed you so much."</p>
            <p>They were both taken aback by this sudden display of affection. Her little brother giggled and pointed at her. Everyone turned to stare. She blushed deeply and jumped back and started walking with them. "I was so surprised when they gave me my memories back. To think this is the family I come from… Did they give you yours back too?"</p>
            <p>Tim was the first to respond as they walked slowly, "They didn't give them back, they were stolen for us. When we began to watch them as a video, they came back."</p>
            <p>"I wish they didn't," Sam said in a quiet voice.</p>
            <p>"Sam, you're here now and safe. Whatever was in your past, it can't hurt you anymore." Gwen tried to reassure him.</p>
            <p>Sam glowered at Gwen. "Your past can always hurt you."</p>
            <p>They continued walking in silence until they reached the rest of the group. Alestra was speaking with the King when they arrived. "Your home is very impressive."</p>
            <p>"I get lucky that I was born into it. I would trade it all to support those I love and respect, if that's what is required."</p>
            <p>"Sam, Tim, this is my father the King of Venus, Moren, and my little brother, Siawn." Moren and Siawn both nodded.</p>
            <p>"Welcome to our home. I've heard wonderful things about you both. Gwen brought home many stories of your times together and the things you discovered in that hellish place. You were all very strong." Moren smiled broadly. "The next thing I need to tell you is that you are about to walk though an aural barrier." They all began to walk together. "It will take your spiritual fingerprint and register you to the castle. "Okay Alestra, Allorien, Tim, and Sam wait here." The ones who had been mentioned stopped walking while the rest continued. The king pulled a small tablet like device out of his pocket. After a few more steps, he stopped and turned around. "Just Alestra, walk forward and keep walking until you feel normal again."</p>
            <p>As she walked forward she shivered as a ding happened on the device in Moren's hand. He looked down at the the device and Alestra paused and stopped in her tracks. "Keep Walking," he commanded. Three seconds later a beeping went off on the pad and she got flung off her feet backward away from the the king, his children, and her mentor. She landed with a thud and a groan on the asphalt of the landing pad.</p>
            <p>Jaedon was the one that explained, "The system rejected you because it didn't get a good read on your aura. It's your first time in the castle." She gathered herself to her feet, the only thing wounded was her pride. This time, she ran. As she hit the same barrier the device dinged again and Moren quickly clicked a button accepting her aural signature into the system. The other two followed her shortly thereafter and, having learned the lesson, both Sam and Tim moved quickly. Again, the aural fingerprint was accepted directly into the system by the king.</p>
            <p>Allorien, the only entity left behind, held their hand up to where the invisible barrier was. A small section of the barrier turned a bright red, it was a bubble of energy that seemed to radiate around in a sphere at all entry points of the castle. As he stood, an alarm started. The tablet registered an aura that didn't quite classify properly in the system. It looked like a weird anomaly or animal, anything but a person. The king looked around alarmed, "Is there someone else here?"</p>
            <p>The alarm stopped abruptly as Allorien withdrew their hand. Jaedon turned to the king. "Yes, we have a hitchhiker, it's a long story. In essence aliens are real, and one is with us." He turned to king "King Moren Romulus of the Republic of Venus meet Mahtan Allorien of the Crysix species." Allorien became visible to the human eye in that moment and Allorien bowed deeply. Allorien spoke in their imperfect raspy voice, "It is an honor to meet you."</p>
            <p>"Please that is unnecessary." Allorien stood back up. The king continued. "The Senate of Venus and our security apparatus has access to the security errors and warnings that occur. Alestra will probably get flagged as being on site because of the rejection, I can explain that. I cannot explain this if it happens again. Right now I can probably explain it as an error in the system or a bat or something." He handed the tablet to Jaedon.</p>
            <p>The tablet showed a rejection error that indicated a non classifiable species. It indicated a pure white aura of spiritual energy. Humans always register as different unique mixes of energies this is as unique as a finger print and allows the castles security system to accept or reject their presence. Jaedon took a look at it and said "pure sprit energy?"</p>
            <p>"I know this magic, it is a base magic to read the aura of people. Like you, I have an aura." As they said this, a white bubble appeared around them. "This," he pointed to the barrier, "is your home's aura. It only allows in those it accepts." They smiled with eyes of excitement. Allorien moved their hand toward the bubble again and as it got closer it began to turn red but didn't register the rejection yet.</p>
            <p>"To allow myself access without your home knowing, I have access I shield myself, with armor from the shield itself," Allorien began to say but then paused. "With your permission I will allow myself access to your space."</p>
            <p>"Yes, of course, if they trust you. I do as well." The king nodded.</p>
            <p>Allorien continued; "With armor of the shield itself mutated around myself I pull this protective layer." As he said some of the red energy came off of the barrier around the castle and created a bubble around their white aura. "Your home will not even know I am here as long as I am enshrined in your home's energy. He put his hand down and started walking forward, both the barriers disappeared. "When I concentrate I can make the energy manifest to your eyes. But, trust me, even though you cannot see it, it is still there." They reached the point where the barrier should have created a notification for the king to approve or deny. No notification came. The barrier did not reject Allorien. In fact the barrier of the castle did not realize that Allorien was there at all. The king looked down at the tablet they all were dots walking though a floor plan of the castle... except for Allorien.</p>
            <p>The king looked over at Jaedon, "I have an endless amount of questions."</p>
            <p>Jaedon looked back at the king, "Unfortunately, I only have so many answers."</p>
