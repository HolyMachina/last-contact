        Having some tech stack problems this week. I'll be back as soon as I can.<br/>
        Next Chapter: September 26th, 2025</p>
            <p>Last Contact is an ongoing small web <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk">hopepunk</a> sci-fi web novel. It takes place mostly in the 23rd and 24th century C.E. I've been working on various versions of this story since about 2005. It's to the point now where I have to stop drafting, rewriting, and editing myself into oblivion and just put it somewhere. The core idea for the story was a "what if" thought I had in 1994.</p>
            <p>Further down this page there are a couple of sections to help navigate this web novel and site. There is a tutorial on <a href="#how-to-read">how to read Last Contact</a>. There is also a brief description of each of <a href="#the-sections">the sections</a> of the web novel. For those of you that have been here before and just want a quick catch up there is a section of the <a href="#last-10-changes">last 10 changes</a>.</p>

            <h2>How to Read Last Contact</h2>
            <p>The story of Last Contact can effectively be read in several different ways.</p>
            <h3> Book (Act) Order</h3>
            <p>Book order is designed to highlight specific themes throughout the story, but jumps back and forth though time. As you're reading follow the banners with the books.<br/>
            <b>Start with:</b> Act 00 - Prologue: Dedication</p>
            <h3>Chronological Order</h3>
            <p>Reading the story in chronological order sequences the events in order by calendar, but can lose some of the larger themes. As you're reading follow the banners with the clocks.<br/>
            <b>Start with:</b> Act 03 - Civil War: Projection</p>
            <h3>Publication Order</h3>
            <p>Publication order sequences the chapters in the order theyâ€™re written. Which jumps around both chronologically and thematically. This order is good for people that are keeping up to date with releases each week. As you're reading follow the banners with the hand holding a pen.<br/>
            <b>Start with:</b> Act 00 - Prologue: Dedication</p>
