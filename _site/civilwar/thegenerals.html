            <h4>Venus - Avalon Castle</h4>
            <h5>Avalon Castle - Main Dining Room</h5>
            <p>The King of Venus led Sam, Tim, Allorien, Gwen, Alestra, and the young prince of Venus Siawn into the main dining hall of the castle. "Sam, Tim, Allorien, please meet Cathy Parino, Oskar Abildgaard, Bamin Abadi, and Dr. Palnov." The king waved to the four people already seated around the absurdly large table.</p>
            <p>Three of the four were in Venusian military uniforms, the remaining one was in a white lab coat and was gruff as if he didn't understand why he was asked to be here. As the newcomers to the room sat in unoccupied chairs, Oskar spoke in a thick Danish accent, "It is so wonderful to meet you all. I have heard such amazing things about you both from Gwen." Gwen blushed deeply, both the boys looked at her. Oskar continued, "As for our unexpected guest," he looked over to Allorien, "I cannot wait to hear how you come to be in our presence."</p>
            <p>Bamin interrupted, "Beyond that, I am sure they are confused. We should introduce ourselves." He leaned forward as salads were delivered by the waitstaff. "My name is General Bamin Abadi. I am in charge of the special forces division of the Venusian Military. Many things will not make sense, but trust me when I say, we are very lucky to have you here. I sent General Beyar," those words made Jaedon look up. "Yes, you've been promoted," General Abadi said as a sidebar "You too Colonel Amalee." He smiled at her. "Anyway, I sent them to rescue the two of you from that god forsaken prison. We cannot complete our plans without you. You will join this war and these two," he waved to the other military members who had not yet introduced themselves, "will train you in the skills needed to overthrow the government of Terra Firma." Sam leapt out of his chair. "What do you mean war?! I was plenty fine to not know who I was or where I had been. Since I've been rescued I've had nothing but pain and heartache and now you are telling me to join a war I don't care about? Absolutely not."</p>
            <p>Allorien, who was sitting next to him, took hold of Sam's wrist and said "Please, calm. You should at least listen to what they have to say. You never know, it may be in your benefit." An otherworldly warmth washed over Sam and he was inexplicably calm. He sat down quietly as if he had been mellowed by Allorien's words. Sitting back down, somehow fully emotionally reset him. Sam paused slightly then Tim, sitting across from him, asked the question both of them were wondering. "What do you mean fight in a war?"</p>
            <p>General Abadi continued "We believe the three of you are going to turn the tide in this war. We have been in a stalemate in many ways with our enemies. Really, our enemies are the rest of Humanity, the part of Humanity which imprisoned you and decided that it was wise to remove your memories."</p>
            <p>Tim leaned forward honestly curious, "why should we fight them? How do we know we're right?"</p>
            <p>Jaedon was the one that responded. "Tim, you were imprisoned before you really knew the state of the world but when you grew up, you and Sam both lived in a society that strives to mold all its members to fit into what they deem is right. Alestra came from that society as well. She had to do many things that she did not want to do just to survive because people honestly believed that it would be more advantageous for her to die then to acknowledge the type of person she is. People hide who they are to survive."</p>
            <p>Sam scoffed loudly and everyone around the table looked at him, "I will not be party to fighting and killing other humans." Allorien smiled broadly, everyone else paused, not sure where to go next.</p>
            <p>During this pause, the waitstaff brought in new plates, this time larger plats with pasta and sausages. The silence continued as the new plates were set down and the salad dishes were removed. However, Gwen's younger brother broke the silence by exclaiming, "Oh! My favorite!" Everyone around the large table turned to him and he blushed and quickly said "I'm sorry father, that wasn't very princely." Jaedon, who was sitting next to the young prince, was the first to speak, "Your father and I are good friends and I think he would agree when I say you did nothing wrong, never hide yourself and your excitement about the world around you under the concept of being proper."</p>
            <p>The king smiled warmly at both of them and nodded. "Yes, I agree. There is plenty of time to learn how to express things in a way that is fit for your role â€” but this is the time to learn yourself and to be excited."</p>
            <p>Moren continued, bringing the conversation back to the topic at hand. "Our world is built of energy. A natural energy that lives all around us and we can harness to do good." Moren held his hand out to his side and a glowing white ball formed inside his palm. "This energy can be manipulated and shaped. Tim, I know you have some experience with this energy. The study of this energy will advance our civilization to the the next levels. However, the government of the enemy, and, to an extent, this government as well, decided that the study of this energy was not a good thing. They believe, we should hold off studying and using this energy. However, their reasons are different. The government of Terra Firma believes it is an affront to their Unified Christian church and therefore should be banned all together. Tim, this is why you were imprisoned. The Venusian government believes that we need to study it more before we use the powers granted to us." Moren paused as a wave of servants entered the room.</p>
            <p>At this point everyone were still eating their main course and the servants refilled drinks. Allorien had been eating this whole time, having no mouth. Jaedon looked over, fascinated. "How do you eat?" His halo and Adam's apple both moved in time with the sounds he created. "We exist from the universe. We have the ability to modify all energy with our minds" He snapped and the ball of white in Moren's hand vanished. "The snap was not needed, it was to prove the point that the event of the energy modification was a result of something I did. Likewise we still need nourishment, however, we break it down at a level of the energy that comprises it and directly use that energy to nourish us. It is the same thing your digestive system does, but we can do so without the objects that humans require."</p>
            <p>A mutter of "that's fascinating" came from Dr. Palnov who the only person who did not seem to have much interest in the food at each course. "Are you saying that everything in existence is comprised of the same energies that we now know?"</p>
            <p>Allorien shifted slightly. "It is slightly more complex than that, but yes. The two of us should speak later; I do not wish to derail this conversation." He snapped and the ball of light appeared back in Moren's hands. It took a second for the King of Venus to notice that the ball was back and regain control of the energy. Allorien slowly transferred control of the loose energy back to the King as he became ready. "Well, that leads us into what I was saying. We need to study this energy further. At this point we know five different elements. Each is a type of energy and everyone is surrounded by their own energy. Which is some form and mix of these five energies. We did not know they comprise everything in the universe, we only understood them to come from natural things. This, is a ball of spirit: it is formed from my love and dedication to you all and to push any boundaries needed to study this energy and allow it to help us grow."</p>
            <p>Allorien interpreted. "May I? What were you planning to do with those particles?"</p>
            <p>The King looked at him awkwardly, "I was just planning to make it vanish again."</p>
            <p>Allorien paused and then said, "I know something better to do with it. These are axion particles, they're also called dark matter. They're freely convertible into forms of energy, physical matter, and other things. Our species uses it as a limitless source of energy. Instead of telling us your feelings, we can feel them ourselves. I will manipulate that ball of energy and break it into one for each of us and implant those feelings into each of us. Is that okay with you all?" There was a wave of nods around the table. Sam looked hesitant, Siawn looked curious, but both of them went along with the crowd, everyone else had such a thirst for knowledge that they were willing to jump in.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes and the ball of white energy moved to the middle of the table, floating just above all the objects on the table. Allorien's halo started spinning quickly and his eyes closed. The ball of light broke apart into thirteen separate smaller balls of energy. Each one quickly flew into the chest of each person sitting at the table, other than the king, and vanished into their chest. There was an audible gasp around the table followed by a calm voice coming from no mouth. "Each of you should now feel the king's dedication and feelings better than any words could ever describe."</p>
            <p>Dr. Palnov was the first to speak about the feelings. All he could do was say was, "We clearly do have a lot to talk about."</p>
            <p>There was a moment of silence while everyone felt the king's feelings on the matter. They each slowly looked at the king. The king smiled at the table.</p>
            <p>"So," Tim said, "these are strong feelings. Now that we have them, what are we to do with them?"</p>
            <p>"I chose to fight, you may make another choice. If you choose to fight, these are the Generals who will guide you. Oskar Abildgaard is an expert in martial combat, both with weapons and without. He will guide the group of you that plan on physical combat." Oskar nodded to the table. "Cathy Parino knows as much as Humanity knows about this energy and the magic it allows us to do. She will guide those of you that are destined for that path." She nodded to the table. "Dr. Palnov is continuing to study these particles, it sounds like you want to spend some time with Allorien." Dr. Palnov nodded.</p>
            <p>"If you choose not to fight," the king continued, "that is fine. Please, take your time. Rest on it. There is no reason to fight if you have no interest in the war and impact its outcome. For now, let us enjoy a meal and get to know each other. All will be welcome to stay here, in the castle, for the evening and the coming days."</p>
            <p>The rest of the meal occurred in quiet conversations between two or three people. The conversations changed pretty frequently except for two people who seemed consistently left out. Siawn and Sam didn't have a whole lot to say to anyone, at least until Siawn asked Sam if he liked pasta. Shortly after that question, the two of them were engaged together and laughing and chatting for the rest of the meal as if they had been best friends forever.</p>
