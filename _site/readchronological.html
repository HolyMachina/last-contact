          <p>Chronological order is designed to tell the story though the constant forward march of time. It can lose some of the themes presented in book order.</p>
          <p><b>Be Aware:</b> the chronological order can interrupt chapters and jump back and forth between them. If you reach a jumping point, a banner will be presented that looks like this:</p>
          <p class="notice">
            ⚠️<b>TIME SKIP:</b> If you're reading in chronological order skip to: <a class="button" aria-disabled="true">Demo Time Skip</a>⚠️
