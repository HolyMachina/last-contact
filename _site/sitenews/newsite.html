        <h2>Site News: Oops, New Site!</h2>
        <p>Publication Date: September 29, 2025<br />
        Estimated Reading Time: 5 minutes</p>
        <section id="what-happened">
            <h3>What Happened?</h3>
            <p>Inherently two things happened.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I wanted to move to small web.</li>
                <li>I lost the ability to use node.js to build new versions of the site.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I was thinking about going small web anyway. Meaning everything on the website is hand coded HTML/CSS and maybe tiny little chunks of JS. This puts the control for the site back in my hands. The old system used a Node.JS react static website builder. It built using NPM and a couple other things. The idea was the system ran code I didn't understand to create the pages that allowed all the JS/CSS/HTML.</p>
            <p>This left me feeling a little out of control of my own content so I was planning to change anyway. Well, I wiped my computer and had trouble reinstalling NPM/Node.js so I took the opportunity to say "Okay. It's time." I'm personally terrible with visual stuff which is why I leaned into the website builder itself so I went looking for a CSS template I could use. I found <a href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.CSS</a> though a mutual on Mastodon. With some light modifications I felt like I was ready to go visually, that feeling was enough for me to say "Okay, I'ma go for it."</p>

        <section id="new-site">
            <h3>New Site</h3>
            <p>As I started coding the new site I expected it to be a lift and shift replicating each page one by one with no changes. That caused me to realize the navigation bars (three of them) were overly complex and made me want to streamline the navigation. I am making index pages for each reading method instead of each act and building the structure that way which means rebuilding the structure of the site and remapping everything. It became a much larger project than I anticipated.</p>
            <p>I was going to take my time with it and rebuild but then on September 24th I realized the old site said I'd be back on "September 19th." Obviously this is a problem. So I tried to edit the old site by hand with little success. It now flashes the new message "next update TBD" then goes right back to saying September 19th.</p>
            <p>This of course prompted me to move forward with a "core structure" and a couple pieces of content (including this blog post) because I wanted to get <i>something</i> out the door. So, here it is. The new site, with most of the content missing.</p>

        <section id="content-migration">
            <h3>Content Migration</h3>
            <p>So, the next step is to get all the content back up. I'm going to prioritize chapters of Last Contact in book order. Once that's done I'm going to put up the other reading orders again. Then I'll focus on the compendium content. Then finally I'll put back up all the historical site news blog posts. Currently there are a couple of chapters up from Act 3 and one chapter up from Act 0.</p>
            <p>I'm not sure how long all that is going to take but I'm very hopeful I'll be done putting all the already written content back up by mid-October. Sometimes I wish I could dedicate all my time to this project, but... gotta work.</p>
            <p>Thanks for understanding.</p>
