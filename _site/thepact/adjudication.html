            <h3>August 16, 2285 C.E.</h3>
            <h4>Eblypso (formerly Proxima Centauri b)</h4>
            <p>The second planet orbiting Proxima Centauri hosted life. Humans didn't know that yet, they still hadn't been past their own solar system. The Venusian government only recently discovered the hint of artificial structures on the surface of this planet in a habitable zone. That fact was still classified. Yet, the life on the surface of Eblypso knew humans. Three stars were visible during the day. Hanging large in the sky, the deep red Proxima Centauri bathed the planet with most of its crimson light. In much smaller form, overhead was the binary system of Alpha Centauri AB. This time of the year, all three were in the sky at the same time. The light provided by this binary system was no more than a tint but still just as valuable to the Crysix. Their entire society lived on this light and the solar energy it provided.</p>

            <h4>Kurrim Cross City</h4>
            <p>The rocky surface of Eblypso was dotted with cities of crystal and glass towers. In some cases, they reached thousands of feet into the sky. Light was captured from the combined Alpha Centauri stars by the top of the tallest crystalline tower and focused though channels to the tops of all the other towers in the city. The light was subsequently divided and focused within each tower to all the rooms within the tower. Every tower in the city was connected in this way. However, there were also eight special towers, one in each core compass direction, that shot light beams over the horizon to the main towers in other cities. As Proxima Centauri traveled over the surface, it always connected with at least one main tower in a city and that city became the light distribution center of the entire planet. Anywhere there was shadow, ice would form instantly. The Crysix found it crucial to drive away shadows at all times.</p>
            <p>Kurrim Cross was the capital of the planet and therefore its largest tower was the center of everything, even when it wasn't hosing the planet's light but receiving it from another city instead. Kurrim Cross was the epicenter of the Crysix species. The other cities were considered rural in comparison. Each other city was designed for a specific purpose, regardless if that was mining resources out of the planet, manufacturing something with various resources, or spreading the solar energy across to the various other cities. Kurrim Cross was the governmental center and housed a majority of the Crysix species.</p>

            <h4>Building 12 - 34th floor.</h4>
            <h5>Species Continuance Court</h5>
            <p>The rooms of Building 12 were built from glass: walls, ceilings, and floors. In fact all the buildings were built this way. Lit by the channels of light in the seams between the walls, the room would be too bright for anyone who wasn't accustomed to the light. This building in particular was a court building and was used to litigate many things. However, this courtroom was being used to litigate the future of a species called Humanity.</p>
            <p>There were eighteen Crysix beings in the courtroom. Fae and Allorien were standing in the middle. Looking down upon them, the High Arbiter had blue skin, a golden halo and charcoal grey wings. The jury was a diverse population. Some had charcoal grey skin, some had bleach white skin like Allorien and Fae, some were various other, mostly pastel, colors. Some had wings, either white or grey, some did not. The High Arbiter was the only one with a golden halo, all the others had a blue one. Everyone in the room shared the long white hair. The High Arbiter, sitting behind a large glass desk, banged a gavel. "Begin."</p>
            <p>Mahtan Allorien stood before a jury of his peers. Yet, Allorien was not the one on trial. Allorien's halo moved above their bone white hair, as they spoke telepathically, "Humanity has not failed! We seeded our genetics on their planet. They, like all our other seeds, grew from that. We've guided them, we've led them. They are so close. We should not exterminate them now."</p>
            <p>Fae, his junior watcher, stood beside him with the counterargument. "Humanity has had a meaningful existence for plenty of time, yet even now, they continue to war with themselves, and have not contacted us. It is time we tried again. In Humanity's 21st century, indifference nearly ruined their planet. They will not be the weapon we need." To many, it was a compelling argument.</p>
            <p>The lead juror directly asked the questions in this court of law. "You have both watched them as a pair, correct?"</p>
            <p>"Yes." they both responded telepathically.</p>
            <p>"So how do you come to such divergent beliefs? Allorien, you contend that humanity should be given another five hundred years. Fae, you contend that humanity has failed and should be eliminated. We've never had a pair of Mahtan disagree so wildly over the species they were charged with."</p>
            <p>Fae started first. "We told them too much. They have been directly influenced and have taken a course different from their natural evolution. We contacted too many people in their species, in conflict with our own rules. Yet, we keep doing that over and over again. Somehow, where humanity is concerned, we keep breaking our pact. And when we've done that, it pushed them further down the path of warring with themselves and not sensing us and reaching out to us. I propose we eliminate the problem once and for all, reseed the planet, and try again. This time, we follow our own rules of non-interference and let the planet grow naturally." Some of the jury nodded.</p>
            <p>"This will be our sixth time doing that. It hasn't worked the other times. The issue is: We've told them the *wrong* things. We've only ever told them part of the story. We've told them we're gods. Which is patently untrue." Some jury members nodded. "We've told them that there is only one right way to see the universe. Which is also untrue." The jury members, who nodded before, gasped at this statement. Other jury members who were unpleased with the first statement nodded at this one. "I recommend we tell them the entire truth. Humanity is not our only children out there, but as Fae said, they are the ones that know the most. We've seeded at least 20 planets. I propose that this one planet is a precious commodity, not something expendable. We should allow them to grow for at least five hundred more years, and during that time, tell them the truth."</p>
            <p>The head juror stood up. "Thank you, with all the evidence you submitted so far we should have enough to decide." Fae and Allorien both bowed as the jury left the glass jury box and went into a room next door. The judge was the next to speak. "Pending decision this hearing regarding the continuation of the species called" they had to shuffle and look at their papers, "Humanity, will stand in recess." They banged the gavel on the glass desk.</p>
            <p>Fae and Allorien looked at each other as they walked back to their desks. "Either way, we'll be going back to them tonight, together." Allorien said privately to Fae.</p>
            <p>"Yes, either to end them, or continue watching them." Fae commented.</p>
            <p>"At least we'll have a path forward. At least we'll know if we're ending them soon or giving them five hundred more years." They both sat sadly and let a soft sigh out of their noses. Neither of them honestly wanted humanity to end, but they were both convinced that they were supporting the right thing to do.</p>
            <p>It was only a few minutes later when the jury walked back in. Fae and Allorien stood, the judge called the court back to order, and the head juror stood.</p>
            <p>"Fae, Allorien, you both, along with Sai, have made a complete mess out of humanity." Both their eyes alit in surprise as the head juror continued telepathically to everyone in the room. "This is the most divided a species continuation hearing has ever been. You look at the same facts and come to entirely different conclusions. You are both adopting the worst facet of the species you watch. Therefore, we cannot trust either of you fully. It is clear that humanity does not deserve another five hundred years. However, it is also clear that they have immense potential. While they have not reached outside their solar system, they have more knowledge of the universe than even some of the species that have reached beyond their star.</p>
            <p>Therefore, our judgement, by seven to six vote, is that we will no longer shelter humanity from other space faring species. That allows them about twenty years to get their act together before they are contacted by their nearest neighbor. If by that time they are still not unified, they will be exterminated by their neighbors. We also decree that any contact you either of you have with humanity must originate from them. Success or failure, you both will be demoted when humanity no longer needs to be watched. We will not reconvene this case."</p>
            <p>"An appeal will be necessary to change this judgement and reopen humanity's case. Case closed." The judge decreed and banged his gavel.</p>
            <p>Allorien said, "I would like to appeal this decision."</p>
            <p>The judge looked down at him, "this is highly irregular. Usually, the appeal process doesn't start until the litigants have at least left the room."</p>
            <p>"This is exceptional information."</p>
            <p>"You have new evidence to share?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, High Arbiter."</p>
            <p>Fae was the next to speak, "why did you not share it in the first place?"</p>
            <p>"It only happened one day ago, and only partly germane."</p>
            <p>The High Arbiter made a judgement, "I will allow the appeal. Present the new evidence."</p>
            <p>Allorien turned to the jury. "One days ago, I was following a member of humanity named Timothy Li. He detected my presence."</p>
            <p>There were many gasps and telepathic whispers that coursed through the courtroom. Allorien knew he was fudging the truth slightly. What occurred a day ago would not be considered detection. His deception went mostly unnoticed in the moment.</p>
            <p>The arbiter banged his gavel on the glass table, "Order!" He yelled telepathically, and the cacophony of whispered thoughts died down.</p>
            <p>Fae rebutted, "why are you only telling me, your partner, about this now?" Fae suspected there was some kind of deception here. Otherwise Allorien would have told him.</p>
            <p>"I did not want it to change how you litigated the case."</p>
            <p>Fae scoffed, "It would not have." He turned to the jury. "I stand in favor of the existing judgement. A crysix being detected does not imply contact will happen and, even if it does happen, it can take nearly the entire human lifespan."</p>
            <p>Allorien spoke up, "however, we have cases where detection and contact happen within five years."</p>
            <p>They started directing comments directly toward each other back and forth. Fae fired back, "Only when that contact was started by the Crysix."</p>
            <p>"But each time has lead to dramatic change in humanity."</p>
            <p>"None of those changes have gotten us to where we need to be, and most have in the long term gone the wrong way."</p>
            <p>"This time is different?"</p>
            <p>"Where's the evidence?"</p>
            <p>"I feel it."</p>
            <p>Fae directed his next comment back to the jury, "Allorien is clearly delirious to think that a feeling, a hunch, is evidence here in a court of law. They have been spending too much time on the species they watch."</p>
            <p>The arbiter banged his gavel. "Counselors, there will be none of that here."</p>
            <p>The jury stood and left the room. They were well versed in what this new information meant, and they were well versed in Humanity's history.</p>
            <p>"This court again stands in recess."</p>
            <p>This time, as they sat, Fae glared at Allorien, "How could you ambush me with that information?"</p>
            <p>"I was hoping it wasn't needed. It's so new. The question is: is it even a sign of things to come?"</p>
            <p>"Exactly why it shouldn't have even been presented yet. It belongs in a report not here."</p>
            <p>"I have to do anything I can to save humanity."</p>
            <p>"That is not your job."</p>
            <p>"It is my duty. I want to erase the regrets and mistakes of the people who came before me."</p>
            <p>"I'll say it again; that's not your job"</p>
            <p>At that moment, the jury reentered the room. The judge banged his gavel, and Fae and Allorien stood.</p>
            <p>The judge spoke to the jury, "please deliver your decision on this appeal."</p>
            <p>The leader of the jury began talking. "The judgement stands amended. We will continue the policy of abandoning humanity to its fate. Contact must still originate from humanity to be valid. However, this case will be automatically reviewed in ten years just before contact occurs. Your demotions will be considered at that time, in the meanwhile you will have no change in status."</p>
            <p>Before they could finish, Allorien said, "I can work with that," and started walking out of the room, much to everyone's surprise.</p>
            <p>The jury continued. "Our decision on this appeal rests."</p>
            <p>The High Arbiter was next to speak. "The case of humanity is suspended, next review will be in ten years."</p>
            <p>Fae sighed. He knew Allorien must have something up his sleeve.</p>
