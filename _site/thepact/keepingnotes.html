            <h4>Mars</h4>
            <h5>Planum Citadel</h5>
            <p>Far from the war on the equator, the south pole of Mars hosted an icy castle. Planum Citadel was covered in carbon dioxide ice. While the castle's skirt of ice came and went with the seasons, the castle was always there. The structure of the castle was steel and concrete. Inside the castle was warm and inviting. The outer shell was only a facade designed to intimidate. It was successful. The castle got very few visitors despite the fact that the residents were the monarchs of Mars' southern half.</p>

        <section id="media-bias">
            <h5>Media Room</h5>
            <p>The bedroom was austere and gilded in gold. The young prince wasn't so young any more. At sixteen he had long dirty blond hair and a carelessly casual demeanor. The room was dark and cold. It was not cold because the building was coated in ice; he just liked it that way. One wall was a series of screens that had on many television programs at once. He chose which one had sound at any give time. He flipped through them quickly, too quickly for anyone else to be able to keep up. As a prince, it was his job to study the political narratives and power players in the solar system. However, this particular news item struck him as odd. He read the headline again. "Dr. Palnov brutally murdered by Venusian Special Forces." He changed the sound over to that program.</p>
            <p>"—Was one of the first graduates of the Columbia University School of Religious Science…" This was the only organization carrying this particular news item. Jamie knew that, when only one news outlet carried a story, it was usually a path to a hidden truth. This particular news story was only on Terra Firma's official news channel. No other independent or Venusian news channel was carrying it. He pulled out a binder and took notes on the story.</p>
            <p>"Fredrick Palnov was responsible for many breakthroughs in science and religion. He was found murdered in his laboratory on September 4th," The news story continued. Jamie wrote into a notebook the fact that the news story was twelve days late. "He single handedly proved that science and religion can go hand in hand. He wrote many essays and books on the topic. His most recent work sparked controversy as it established that reincarnation is real and many of the people who walk among us are historical figures. Well respected in all scientific and religious circles, he worked directly for our glorious Chancellor Fulton and was personal friends with the archbishop of the Unified Christian Church. He was orphaned at a young age when his parents where killed in a terrorist bombing in London, also arranged by the Venusian Special Forces. The Chancellor has promised swift military action against the parties responsible."</p>
            <p>Jamie rolled his eyes. He knew that meant another battle will happen on Mars. There was already nothing but war on Mars. Terra Firma couldn't attack Venus, so they just took it out on Mars. Just then, the door opened and his parents walked in. Jamie quickly muted the TV as his father came to sit by him. "Jamie, there's something I have to tell you."</p>
            <p>The Queen of Mars stood in the doorway. The young man turned to his father with concern. "What's that dad?"</p>
            <p>The middle aged man shifted uncomfortably. "You know that I am your father and will always love you. As well as you know that I am not allowed to marry your mother."</p>
            <p>"Not allowed to?" Jamie had never heard him use this phrasing before.</p>
            <p>"Yes, The Chancellor will not allow us to marry. It was his condition for allowing me to stay alive. Your mother bargained for my life." He could see his son was shocked.</p>
            <p>"Why? Why would she have to do that? Who is this Chancellor?" The prince was astounded the leader of his government would force someone to bargain for the life of someone they love.</p>
            <p>"You will find out who he is in time. What is important for you to know now is my past." Serim Aktug swallowed deeply. "Before I fell in love with your mother, I was a member of an elite team in the Venusian Military. I grew up on the other side of Mars. I was recruited by their military because I was sick of the constant fighting and I vowed to put an end to it. I became a corporal and had many skills which I hated. I was in line for the biggest job, it would have ended the war and brought peace. At least I thought so. My assignment was to assassinate your mother."</p>
            <p>He looked at his golden-haired mother, with love but also maturity. On Mars, children grew up too quickly. He was only a child, but he knew he would be king during a war. His mother was queen during a war; his grandfather and great grandfather had also been kings during wartime. Most people believed he would continue the war. At sixteen, he still thought everyone should get along. Nobody saw the hidden maturity in his eyes. Most of the time, his concerns were written off as wishful thinking. He turned toward his dark haired father, "Why do we have to keep constantly fighting?"</p>
            <p>"Jamie, Mars is a place where our way of living and another, different way of living exist together. Every time those two ways have existed side by side, fighting has occurred."</p>
            <p>"Just because it has always happened, it doesn't mean it should continue to. They aren't that different from us, why should we keep fighting?"</p>
            <p>"Now son," His mother spoke up at this point, "We don't really have a choice. We are a colony of Terra Firma. We must follow the directions of Chancellor Fulton." Jamie shivered. His father got up and started walking away in silence as if that was the accepted answer. Every conversation about changing the status quo ended like this. As his father reached the door, Jamie looked directly in the eyes of his mother. "Have we even spoken with the other side, isn't that the job of a leader?"</p>
            <p>She looked back at him deeply, "No, we would quickly lose our power and agency if we did so." She and her partner left the room closing the door behind them, but left him with one last line just before closing the door, "We would be freezing out on the streets."</p>
            <p>Jamie considered it for a long second as he watched all kinds of fighting and horror on various news agencies. He realized in that moment that he had a book that could apparently get him advice from off the planet, one he hadn't used since he got it. Muttering to himself, "it might be better for our kingdom to fall if it means Mars can be whole again."</p>
            <p>Jamie sighed deeply unable to process in the moment everything he had been told. Rising slowly, he turned off all the equipment and walked out to the hallway. The distant wall was covered in windows that let him look out over the half planet that would eventually become his. Was constant fighting going to be his life?</p>

            <h4>Mars - Planum Citadel</h4>
            <h5>Prince's Quarters</h5>
            <p>Jamie was laying on a couch in the sitting room of his personal suite. The room was cold, one of the windows was open to the icy air of the southern pole of Mars. The large fireplace remained unlit. A large hardcover book was cradled on his thighs as he snacked on a bag of chips. He had been here alone for the last week. The door creaked open and he was expecting a servant bringing food. It was his father.</p>
            <p>Jamie gasped, and jumped off of the plush couch, the chips and book tumbling to the floor. Jamie put his fists up toward his father in a defensive stance, ready to punch him.</p>
            <p>"Whoa, I didn't do it, did I?" his father found himself bargaining again, this time to keep his son's anger at bay.</p>
            <p>Jamie put his fists down, but wasn't convinced. "You're still the enemy." Somehow hearing this made the room feel even colder.</p>
            <p>Serim sighed, "That is the kind of thinking that created a rule that I cannot marry the woman I love. When your mother and I fell in love I told my superiors and she told the Chancellor. My superiors demanded I continue with my mission. The Chancellor wanted me dead, and he didn't even know who I really was, just that I was from the north. Please, son, sit."</p>
            <p>Jamie begrudgingly relaxed a little bit and sat back down. His father carefully sat next to him as he continued telling Jamie the story that happened before his own life.</p>
            <p>"Your mother and I tried to build a bridge between worlds. We tried to unite Mars. Both the Venusian government and the Terra Firma government strongly opposed the union, and our love. It wasn't long until we found out she was pregnant. Both sides wanted to use you, use us, as their pawns to win the war and declare victory. That's when we learned that nobody cares about Mars and its people. The whole planet is a bargaining chip. A card to be played. We refused to accept that." Serim's dedication was clear in his voice.</p>
            <p>"When you were born, the Terra Firma government was nice enough to give me a new identity so that I could be your father and help you grow. I promised never to tell you all this information. My real name is Serim Aktug. If anyone can continue our dream of building a bridge between the cultures, it is you. I don't even know if you believe me."</p>
            <p>They both looked awkwardly at the ground as a moment's silence crossed the room. Serim noticed the book he was reading *History of Humanity: 1900-1950* Looking around the room it was clear that Jamie was reading though a large set of books with orange spines. All the books were titled "History of Humanity" but had different dates. "Those books were published in 2200. Terra Firma made a set and Venus made a set. They are slightly conflicting in some ways. That one, with the orange spine is Venus' version." Serim pointed at the bookshelf. "The ones with the blue spine are from Terra Firma. Exact same books, very different story."</p>
            <p>Jamie looked at his father. "Why does all this matter? It just looks like people having hate for one another. We clearly can't change and be better."</p>
            <p>"Ah, that's where you're wrong. Keep notes. Read them both. Find the differences. With all the hate, there's always more love. Find it. Note it. You'll be the leader we couldn't be." Serim stood up and walked toward the door. As he got to the door, Jamie noticed that his mother was standing in the doorway. His father spoke again, "If anyone can find the truth, it's you."</p>
            <p>As Serim and the Queen of Mars left the room, there was a quiet "Thanks dad." that followed them. Both parents smiled broadly.</p>
