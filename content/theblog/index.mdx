# The Blog

## Where did I find myself?

Well... This is my blog.

It's a blog.

Like any other blog.

Except... There's one section called "World Events" where these events have, or will, directly impacted the Last Contact universe.

The views are my own and not that of my company or any of the characters in Last Contact.

## Posts?

### World Events

These are events that happened in real life that *directly impact* the Last Contact story.
