# Discord Server

Well, I made a discord server for fans. If you want to join, please do so!

You can find a link [here](https://discord.gg/kGT7FA7fWr).

There's also one in the nav bar!

There's also one on the about me page.

There's also one in the footer...

Too much?

Oh and here's the weird built in discord widget thing:
