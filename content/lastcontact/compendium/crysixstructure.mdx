# Crysix Social Structure

The Crysix are a non-human species that have a generally humanoid shape. They have pale white skin and light eyes with white hair. Their facial features are generally very soft and similar to humans except they do not possess a mouth. Generally wearing white robes with embroidery. The higher their rank in society the more elaborate and delicate their robes are. Most crysix are very physically weak preferring to only perform light activities. They all have rings they call connectors which they can choose to position either above their head or behind their head. Those rings, to a human, would look very much like a halo.

The Crysix have an extremely rigid caste class system within their society. With a specific hierarchy and nesting structure. When each member of the crysix race is born they are born with a clear connector. As they age their skills and abilities are measured frequently. Those measurements are used to assign each member into a specific caste as they come of age at around 80 years old. Some classes have different singular and plural words for identification of plurality. If a class has a different singular form, it will be in parenthesis after the plural form for that class.

## About each caste

### Ereinion (Círdan)

As a group of castes the Ereinion are the highest ranking people in the Crysix in the species. They are all revered as deities. They control the species with an Iron Fist. If a problem gets all the way up to the royalty someone usually gets punished. They have engineered the Crysix to control themselves. They are basically watchers and mostly benevolent rulers.

#### Indis & Andratta

The Royal Couple are nothing short of a God and Goddess to this species. They control all of the Crysix. They go to the Gildor for their view of the universe. Through those eyes they see all. They are never questioned. They slightly fear the Amrod, because they fear being watched without their knowledge. They are attended to by the Dain in all private matters. In all public matters they work though the Galdor.

#### Dain

The Dain are a caste of society that see to any needs of the Indis and Andratta. They maintain the household and attend to all needs of the Indis and Andratta that are not official business. They are identified and chosen from a different caste and hand picked to serve the royal household. They are specifically honored in society and are one of the most influential groups.

#### Galdor (Fingon)

The Galdor are demigods. They are the visible leaders of the species. They are somewhat like lieutenants. The Royal Couple will assign a Galdor to each major department of their species. Those lieutenants will each lead a sector of the species. They provide the orders downstream from the Royal Couple to the Taurnil. If any dispute or disagreement reaches this level of visibility it is solved quickly by the Galdor.

#### Gildor (Gelmir)

Gildor report to the Galdor and The Royal Couple about what's going on in the universe. They are the eyes and ears of the leadership of the Crysix. They have two forms. One form is a connection to the psychic world; the other form is a connection to the physical world. They have the same memory in both forms, but they cannot interact with the opposite world. Therefore, a Gildor needs to be in the same form as another Gildor to interact with them. They need to be in physical form to interact with any other physical being in the universe. They also provide details of their observations to the Silinda and Silinde who create the strategy for the species.

- Elros (Elendil): The Gildor's physical form, they have a body that looks mostly normal (for a Crysix). This is the only form visible. They can use their eyes and other physical senses as well as their connector. This is their form connected with the PHYSICAL world. They have no connection with the spiritual/magical/psychic world in this form.
- Amrod (Amras): The psychic from of a Gildor, they are invisible to everything except psychic powers. They frequently use this form to pass secret messages from Amrod to Amrod. They are very secretive when in this form. These are the only class of people in the Crysix species The Royal Couple fear slightly.

### Amroth

As a group of castes the Crysix Amroth are excellent administrators. Their job is control. The Taurnil report directly to the Galdor. Their job is to make sure everything is running smoothly on a day to day basis. They pass judgement on disputes and build the strategic plans for the species.

#### Taurnil (Elessar)

These people are the leaders of Glorfindel. They give orders down to the Glorfindel. They control who does what and when in the big picture. This group gives the orders that execute the plans created by the Silinde and Silinda. They are administrators. No more, no less. They are lost without people below them, they are lost trying to make plans, they frequently feel lost, and give orders to fill that void.

#### Orodreth (Mablung)

All fights within the Glorfindel come directly to the Orodreth. They are revered as the judges. They are extremely humble and wise. They have far more wisdom then intelligence, which make them perfect judges. They will expect that what they say should be done gets done. It's a trust in the right place; everyone in this species listens to their superiors. They file reports of their judgments back to the Taurnil.

#### Silinde (Golradir)

This group of the Crysix Amroth, in part, makes the plans the Taurnil use. They spend a lot of time in conference with Silinda. Silinde know what needs to change, what polices need to be adapted. They are intellectuals, do a lot of research about thoughts. When they aren't planning changes for the Crysix they are in libraries reading. They however are horrid with logistics. Changes in the species always start here, it doesn't matter if it's a policy or procedure change.

#### Silinda (Eö)

The Silinda do all the logistical planning for the Silinde's plans. If it is not a feasible plan they will discuss the plan over with the Silinde until it is feasible. Once they have agreed on a plan they bring it to the Taurnil together. Where the Silinde are the thinkers and idealists, the Silinda are the rational side, they see if the plans can actually work. They are incredibly skilled with scheduling and timing events and changes.

### Glorfindel

The Crysix Glorfindel are all the workers of the species. They do the various things the Ereinion and Amroth have been planning. While there is no *specific* hierarchy within this category beyond the Findecáno, some casts are treated better than others.

#### Findecáno

These are the low level managers; they run from planet to planet, solar system to solar system, keeping an eye on their charges. They get direction direct from the Taurnil. They are direct supervisors of all those below of them they are supposed to report to the Valandil who then report to the Taurnil. However, lately they have been bypassing the Valandil and speaking directly to the Taurnil especially about emergencies.

#### Valandil (Huor)

The Valandil serve only a bureaucratic purpose. They are nothing but paper pushers. They receive reports from the Findecáno and file those reports to the Taurnil. They are not frequently skipped however, and they have been less and less useful in recent years. Most of the Ereinion expects them to be gone soon, and every Huor will be found a place in a different caste, most of them will be moving to become Findecáno.

#### Fingolfin

The Fingolfin are all the physical laborers in the Crysix. They are treated extremely well as this is the labor that nobody in the species wants to do. Interestingly they are the most physically weak of the crysix because they use mental kinetic abilities to execute their manual labor. If a Fingolfin gets 'noticed' they will be anointed as a Dain and they will be moved to the royal household and revered.

#### Taurnalê

The Taurnalê are the police of the Crysix species. They are very good at every defensive magic known to the galaxy. They are very frequently called in to protect higher ranking Crysix. They are used only by order of the Taurnil. They have the longest life spans of the Crysix save The Royal Couple. They are not very good at fighting on the front lines of war, they do not have the blood lust, and in fact the Crysix as a species does not. They are protectors. They do that job better than anyone else in the Galaxy.

#### Erora

The Erora are the defenders of the Crysix species universe wide. They defend all interests of their species with fervor. They are very skilled in defensive magic and magic that can damage physical forms and beings. Erora are never brought in to defend against their own species. They are solely employed in defending the species against external threats. They have very short life spans compared to other Crysix their lifespan is more similar to a human. They are the most emotional sect of the Crysix species. They also reproduce faster than any other sect.

#### Darcassan

The warriors of the race. They have an extreme blood lust unlike most of their species. Members of this caste are sent to other worlds to attack other species and races that are declared as enemies. They know magics of extreme power that can decimate whole planets at once.

#### Mahtan

The Mahtan serve a very specific purpose. They watch. The Crysix have spawned many species throughout the years. A Mahtan is assigned to each species to watch them for the Mahtan's life span. It is the most boring job in the Crysix, but it is by far the most rewarding, because you get to see first had the purpose of the whole species. They report to the Findecáno and are always instructed not to get involved with their charges.

#### Ithronel

The masters of visual art works and culture. While they are not treasured by the Crysix they are treated fine. The work they produce is seen as unnecessary but enjoyable leisure pursuits. They report to the Findecáno and provide all their works of art for the betterment of their entire race.

Connector Color: Olive

#### Elroris

The masters of non-visual art works and culture. While they are not treasured by the Crysix they are treated fine. The work they produce is seen as unnecessary but enjoyable leisure pursuits. They report to the Findecáno and provide all their works of art for the betterment of their entire race.

#### Rathal

Masters of physical pleasures the Rathal are the lowest and least respected and powerful caste of Crysix Society. They report to the Findecáno and most of their work goes unnoticed by most people because their work is deemed very shameful. It is the view of the entire species that only the weakest of the Crysix seek to employ a Rathal.
