### Lagrange Point 2 - Venus

#### Edith

##### Bridge

An alien, dressed in blue thread embroidered white robes with a blue halo stood on the bridge of a human spacecraft visible and known for the first time in human history. Jaedon was the first to speak, "I have so many questions." The AI of the space craft, Edith, spoke next, "Me too!"

Allorien injected into their minds *And I'm excited to answer them*

They all stood their unspeaking for a moment. Alestra grabbed the initiative "So, you're a telepathic being?"

"That doesn't help *me*" Edith retorted.

"It's not always about you." Jaedon chided.

"Well, it should be" came a quiet audio over the ship's speakers. At the same time that *Yes, I am,* manifested in all their minds.

Tim adopted radical acceptance of the moment he was in. "Why are you here?"

*For you.*

Everyone paused. "Why is Tim special?" Sam asked.

*He's not, you all are. You each have skills, Tim was just the person who contacted me.*

Allorien held his hand in front of him and molecules of water vapor around him started becoming visible and condensing. They started quickly moving into his hands. The water formed into a large ball and sloshed around. *These are the effects of axion particles*

A surprised voice spoke up from a tall woman, "It looks just like a ball of water."

*It is now.* Allorien spent some time demonstrating and explained. *An axion is a particle that moves across the galaxy faster than light. It's what you called "Dark Matter" at one point, and can be manipulated to become any other particle or particles. It forms the basis of the magic you use Tim, and also, what you call quantum well... anything.*

##### Training Room

Allorien converted Tim's practice room into something more apt for magical training. The bright lights in the room did not function. No electricity flowed to the room anymore, Allorien claimed it would be a hindrance. The floor had a covering of dirt. There were candles all over the room, currently unlit. Allorien glowed a soft wite color and offered the only light in the room. In one corner, there was a small pond that had a water flow, but it had no source or destination. There was also an airflow though the room that was not provided by the spacecraft.

Allorien knew Jaedon wanted to watch, but since there was no electricity flowing to that room, the cameras did not work. Allorien saw in Jaedon understanding and control of the energy but not enough power to mold it. Allorien motioned for Tim to sit on the ground in the middle of the room. Sitting with him Allorien said "This is going to feel like an invasion of your mind, and of your deepest secrets. However, know that I will do no such thing. I will be connecting with you on a level that no human has ever connected before. Be calm. Don't panic."

Tim breathed deeply. The next time he blinked he awoke in a city of crystal and glass standing next to Allorien. He felt oddly calm, but very confused. "Where are we, weren't we on a spaceship?"

*We are, this is a mental projection.* Tim passed out; his body could not handle the amount of added information passing though his mind.

About an hour later Tim woke up laying on the dirt in a candlelit room. A raspy unpracticed voice greeted him, "You stood in the memories of my home. I'm sorry, that was too much."

Allorien really thought he was ready, he was sitting calmly next to the collapsed Tim.

"No, it's fine, I just was surprised." Tim got to a sitting position in the dirt. "I have always wondered; if you have no mouth, how do you speak?"

"Our anatomy is like yours, but not quite the same. We have an Adam's apple as you call it." Allorien rubbed their neck and the voice changed as Allorien made a couple of sounds of varying pitch. "We are not assigned genders at birth everyone has it in our species. We use it for speech like in your case. However, we cannot speak until it grows in puberty. Until then we must communicate though telepathy. If you watch closely both my halo as you call it and my neck move during my speech." Allorien moved their neck and halo in a series of vibrations. "My neck vibrates the air around me to create a series of pitches, and my ring pushes that air toward you."

Suddenly Allorien's halo stopped moving. Tim heard a faint whisper. "If the air is not moved to you it creates a faint whisper there is no volume. The faster the air moves, the more volume we create."

Then Allorien's halo spun and his neck did not move. Tim felt a rush of air fly by his ears, but there was no speech carried. Allorien's halo calmed and waved back and forth in a hypnotizing manner. His head echoed with a telepathic explanation. *When my neck doesn't move the only sound is the wind. When I do telepathy it only needs my ring. Since we are born with those, we can speak but not audibly until puberty.*

Tim took all this in, there is such a difference in experience in the universe. To think that humans, for so long, had presumed they were alone. "How big is the universe?"

"That is something even we are unsure of, however, when you consider the energies of the universe you can find a calm that makes sense." Allorien stood up and waved his hand, his halo started spinning and the dirt in the room whipped up by the wind into a tornado no larger than Tim. The tornado circled around Tim a couple of times as he kept speaking. "As all the elements travel around us, they are manipulated by us. As you learn to control it you can do it by thought but many people manipulate these energies by their emotion and without thinking. The axion particle can replace any natural element in a spell or be converted for a purpose."

Allorien sat down, the tornado still twisting around Tim. Allorien's halo was rotating at the same speed as the small tornado. "Your species has called this magic. It is the art of twisting and bending a series of particles to your will. It is the most powerful tool we have and runs most of our lives. It also provides an infinite source of energy, and food." Allorien exhaled, the ring behind him stopped spinning, and the dirt in the tornado fell straight to the ground.

If Tim did not see it with his own eyes, he would not believe it. Sure, his parents were teaching him when it was young, but this is amazing. This could be a revolution for humanity. Why hasn't humanity developed it? Why did Terra Firma outlaw it? Why did Venus not study it more?

"Because it takes a certain amount of skill to see that value. Only one other person has had that amount of skill. He was killed by people who didn't understand."

There was a long pause as Tim thought through historical figures his mind paused briefly upon Jesus of Nazareth. Allorien's voice echoed though his mind *Yes, him.*

"How did you..."

"Read your mind? We have connected now. You can see into my mind, and I can see into yours."

"That's creepy." Tim shifted uncomfortably.

"It is by choice; I will never see something past your surface level thoughts unless you let me. Will you let me take you on a trip inside my mind?"

Tim nodded. "Of course, you have already taught me so much."

Allorien sighed deeply.

## December 25, 1984

### Eblypso

#### Tower 12

##### Street Level Entrance

Tim and Allorien were standing on a clear sidewalk. Underneath them a crystal train rushed along a monorail making a soft woosh. They saw a young Allorien speaking with an older, Crysix with a gray halo, in front of a large crystal and glass building. In this moment Allorien's halo was clear and he was wearing a white shirt and shorts, not the robe to which Tim was accustomed. The older Crysix was taking the last steps to prepare Allorien for his role, "You know that will watch humanity. Some have said they are our worst children; some have said they are our best. It depends on how they grow. Please, come with me. This is the day you become a Mahtan."

Allorien, thought though the mental projection with Tim's mind. *These are my memories, we cannot interact with them, and they cannot interact or see us. The past cannot change, but I can live it as many times as I want. Please follow me.* The four of them started to walk into the building.

##### Rooftop Ceremonial Center

The rooftop shined in crystal and glass. Solar light from three stars shined down upon the building. Tim, the first human ever to delve into the memories of an alien, struggled to keep his eyes open standing in Allorien's memories. *Oh,* Allorien thought, and it echoed into Tim's mind. *I guess the light is still blinding for a human even in my memories* Allorien held out his hand and a pair of dark sunglasses appeared. They bent down slightly in their white robes to put the glasses onto Tim as he winced from the light.

Tim blinked a little bit behind the glasses. He began to see a large stage on one side of the rooftop with a podium standing 7 feet tall and a single chair. About a hundred Crysix members with shining white skin sat quietly in white robes with various colors of halos sat awaiting this moment. These beings were all of Allorien's family and friends collected together for this moment were Allorien takes their role in the grater society.

*Where would you like to stand? Remember nobody can see or hear us, this is just a memory,* The older Allorien instructed to his human guest.

"On the stage please," Tim answered. *Well, I guess we can sit then.* Allorien thought for a moment and two new chairs appeared next to the chair that already existed. *This will be an interesting view of the ceremony for sure.* They walked up though the middle aisle of seating and took the stairs up to the stage. Tim took the middle seat and the adult Allorien sat on the outside. Looking down they could see the young Allorien seated in the front row between the person talking to them before and another person talking to them that had an olive colored halo.

A member of the crysix race came from stage left. Roughly 10 feet tall, this person would have towered above everyone else in the room. As they walked up in front of the chairs to the podium and shuffled some papers around that were already sitting on the podium. He began to communicate telepathically *Today, we, together, have the great honor of welcoming this young member of our society. My name is Fingon Nasir and I lead the caste of our society that form our military. I lead the caste of our society that build our future. I lead the caste of our society who leave home and not return often.* As they said this the Crysix with the Olive halo began to cry. "The young person we honor today, Allorien, has decided to step away from all of you with the express purpose of helping a species they chose to grow. Each of us made a sacrifice when we took our roles. Their sacrifice today is to put this other species above our own. From this day you will not see them often, and that will be painful." Saying this Tim could feel a wave of sadness form from each of the people in the audience. It hung in the air above the audience and there was a slight fog that formed. There was a moment of pause where everyone sat with the fog of their feelings.

"What's that?" Tim asked.

*That, is the feelings of everyone in the audience. Those are axion particles given visible properties.*

"Please, help me welcome Allorien to the stage." Fingon Nasir started clapping, they were the only one clapping, but one by one the halos of all the other people in the room spun pulling the air across the rooftop creating volume. It was applause, but it sounded oddly unified having only be created by one pair of hands. The young allorien wearing white shorts and a short sleeve shirt sat next to Tim in the empty chair on stage. "How old were you? You look so young." Tim asked realizing this young allorien looked to be in his early teens.

*Here? I was eighty four.* the older Allorien thought as a form of response.

"Wait! How old are you now."

*Now? I'm three hundred and seventy five.*

Tim looked at the older Allorien in shock. Before Tim could fully processes it, Fingon Nasir stopped clapping and continued speaking telepathically to everyone on *Today Allorien here joins the most important branch of our military. The watchers. Allorien will be granted the title of Mahtan and dispatched to a world of their choosing to watch the species that most excited them while learning the history of all of our children. Allorien, who have you chosen?*

As if prepared for this moment there was no hesitation in young Allorien's response *I choose humanity.*

Turned toward Allorien it was clear that Nasir was speaking directly to them, but everyone could hear. *Humanity has had many ups and downs of their history. Most people don't even know they exist. Humanity also caused a great deal of strife for our species.* Nasir turned back to the audience *All of you have been part of raising a person who is curious, enjoys a challenge, and wants only the best for everyone. This is an honor to you all.* The fog cloud got a little denser as the audience felt pride and happiness in the person Allorien had become. Turning back toward the child in the room the next query came from Nasir, *Allorien, to where while you be dispatched?*

Again, no pause, *Planet Earth, in the Sol Star System.*

Stepping out from behind the podium Nasir said this next bit as if trying to kill a bit of time, *The Sol System is a place nearby us, we found the planet humans called Earth before we found any other habitable planets. We've studied and seeded Earth multiple times. Only a little over 4 light years away, Earth is our nearest populated neighbors. Maybe Allorien won't be so distant after all* There was a short echo of laughter. Everyone knew Military Members weren't allowed to come back except when directly summoned. The person with the olive halo started sobbing even harder. Nasir took a spot in the middle of the front of the stage and continued, *Allorien will walk a path that some of this species' most famous and most infamous have walked. The Mahtan of Earth are some of the most well known. Humanity, is difficult to watch, and they have ended up leading many Mahtan down a difficult path, even so much as causing civil war in our species around two thousand years ago."

A person with a yellow halo walked on stage from the right side, and walked up to Nasir and handed him a scroll being careful to obscure the middle of the scroll. They quickly retreated off stage as Nasir continued *With this scroll Allorien's request has either been approved or denied. Thank you, Dain Sana.* As the Dain retreated off the stage Nasir held the middle of the scroll with one hand and one end with the other. As he raised it up into the air the ribbon in the middle was exposed to be green. Young Allorien let out a sigh. Everyone in the room said *Approved!* telepathically. *Allorien please rise to take your oath* Young Allorien rose and walked up to the front of the stage.

"Oath?" Tim said

Adult Allorien sighed a little bit, *Yes, you are seeing the time when I became an adult, each adult member of my species takes an oath.*

The Fingon began reading the oath from the document which each section repeated by Allorien.

> I Allorien,  
> do hear by commit,  
> to watch humanity,  
> and not interfere,

As Allorien said these things the fog cloud over the audience faded from white to blue getting more colored with every word. At this point Nasir appeared to be reading in autopilot have memorized the rest of it.

> taking the title Mahtan,  
> as a part of this military,  
> I vow to always put humanity first,  
> they are our future, and our path to victory.

There was a long pause as everyone seemed to expect something to happen, but nothing did. Fingon Nasir looked back down at the document... *Oh right, humanity. Sorry, I forgot there's more.*

> I Allorien,  
> do hear by promise,  
> to not inject into humanity,  
> any new mythology, beliefs, or principles.

As soon as Allorien finished the words the fog cloud consolidated into a blue ring the size of a halo of the adults in the room. The smaller clear one fell from behind Allorien's head and clattered onto the floor. There was a long pause and a lot of various cheering.

*Well,* as the cheering died down, Nasir continued, *there's only one matter left to be handled. How would you like to be identified?*

There was a long pause, as if this was the question that Young Allorien was not expecting. *I'm not sure.*

*What's in your heart in this moment?*

*He/They.* As soon as those words were uttered from Allorien's mind the blue halo flew from above the crowd and attached to the back of his head. Before everyone's eyes Allorien grew six inches taller, became slightly more muscular and developed in a moment to the form that Tim recognized as the Adult Allorien sitting beside him. Nasir gathered a robe from the inside of the podium and put it on Allorien.

For the first time in the ceremony Fingon Nasir spoke audibly "I present to you all Mahtan Allorien. He is now an adult ready to play their role in our tapestry. May he be an honored name in our history."

Everyone rose to their feet cheering in various ways. Tim looked over at the Allorien sitting next to him who was crying slightly.

### Lagrange Point 2 - Venus

#### Edith

##### Training Room

Their consciousnesses returned to sitting on the dirt covered floor of the training room. *So, that's the day I became a Mahtan and was assigned to watch your species. As well as the oath I took. Tim looked at them dead in the eyes, "haven't you broken that oath by showing me and instructing me so much?" Allorien looked down at the ground, and spoke in his raspy voice, "It is likely that after I return to my home, I will be punished in some way, yes."

"So, why did you choose us?"

"Reading your history, I saw great potential. I also felt sad for what we did to you."

"Wait, what? I thought we somehow sparked a civil war in you?"

Allorien chuckled slightly, "That's apocryphal. When I was reading your history as a child it was clear to me that even though we couldn't admit it to ourselves, we influenced your development. That then subsequently influenced us into a civil war. There will be plenty of time for us to talk about this stuff. What's the most important question?"

"Why the tears at the end?" Tim looked into Allorien's eyes.

"That's the most important thing to you?" Allorien blinked in surprise.

"Yes."

Allorien sighed deeply, "I don't go back to that memory often anymore. I miss a lot of them. They put all their faith and belief in me in that moment. I'm sure my actions have disappointed some of them. I suspect I am not known in a positive light on my planet. I gave them up to come here, I chose you all over them. It's lonely, you all are quite a challenge. Seeing that again reminded me of the burden."

Tim paused then took Allorien's hand. "I'm sure I don't know the whole context, but I think you've done an amazing job. I'm the first human to see a crysix coming of age ceremony, right? That's quite a thing." Allorien looked up and smiled at him.
