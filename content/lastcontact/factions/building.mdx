# Building

## February 14, 2275 CE

### Terra Firma

#### New York City - Impulse Tower

##### Floor 52 - Conference Room Alpha

"There will be forty-eight. Each one of you will build three." Chancellor Fulton stood at the front of the room with his six generals. Each of my generals will work with four of you. These designs are the most confidential designs you will ever work on. If you share the full extent of these plans with anyone outside of this room, you will die. These towers will be the tallest ever constructed." The sixteen architects had very wide eyes. The greed was filling the room. Fulton always read the room. "Yes, you will all receive more payment than you've received for a single project in your life. Now, onto the project. General." Fulton stepped back.

The general wearing light blue stepped forward "Each tower will have a central core controlled by the army. Externally to that will be mixed use residential, commercial and office space. You will be provided a limited blueprint of the inside core of the tower, there will remain a section of the internal section of the tower that will remain classified. All power, water, cooling, and data connections will come from the inside tower to the outside tower. You may design the external structures each tower to be however you wish. The external of the tower needs to be intimidating and project all the power that the office of the chancellor has. However, nobody in the other spaces should be able to physically access the military spaces and vice versa."

The general wearing black, with red and grey patches, shifted slightly clearly worried about how the reaction the next section would provoke. Chancellor Fulton noticed this, stepped forward and continued the air force general's presentation, "Within the central core there will be a smaller central core that will house pure ordinance. It may come to a point where the rest of the building needs to fall away, so that the ordinance can effectively annihilate the city around it. This process should destroy the rest of the tower with little to no warning. It is never expected to be used." He said the last part as a way of reassurance however many of the engineers shifted slightly.

Chancellor Fulton continued, "I see you are uncomfortable with this. Know that if we use these buildings for their destructive capability, they will destroy 10% of the population of this planet. You are the best of the best. If anyone can do it, you can. If anyone doesn't want to take part in this, you should leave now."

A woman in the far corner stood and started toward the door. Chancellor Fulton nodded to his green clad general. There was a flash of light, a loud bang and the engineer was on the floor. Everyone around the conference table looked horrified. The army general nodded back to Chancellor Fulton. Chancellor Fulton and the other generals were stone faced and placid.

Fulton was the first to speak "Anyone else? Know that the only way you will leave this project, is how she did." The chancellor paused and nobody else stood up. "Okay, three of you will now build four of them. You have some of the most classified information in our government right now. We will be watching you and assessing you throughout the course of this project. So, who wants the honor of an extra tower to build?" Three male architects put their hands up quick to comply. One by one the other hands raised. Chancellor Fulton could tell they went up in fear. "Good. I will leave the rest of this discussion to my generals."

Chancellor Fulton made eye contact with each of his generals and saw the expected resolve. He felt comfortable enough to march across the room and exit. When the door sealed behind him, he sighed and muttered "why is fear the only effective way to lead people?" The quiet response came from behind him. "It's not." Chancellor Fulton spun around and drew his side arm. Standing next to the door was his closest adviser. "Don't scare me like that. I didn't see you."

"I know." Master Vera'Cruz came up to Fulton and they started walking together back toward the elevator to the penthouse. "You know you could be a benevolent leader." The chief-of-staff cast a side eyed glance at the chancellor. Chancellor Fulton stopped in his tracks and was staring at him. Vera'Cruz magically saw a red aura around the Chancellor. The anger welling up in the Chancellor made Vera'Cruz stop in his tracks. His muscles tightened. This was not the expected reaction, he didn't expect the Chancellor and his childhood friend to turn on him like this. Vera'Cruz needed to smooth this over. He said, "maybe I was mistaken."

"See how effective that was?" Chancellor Fulton relaxed. He pressed the button for the golden elevator. There was one button. It didn't matter which way it was going; it was the only elevator that made it to the penthouse ane the single person who was allowed to call for it was the Chancellor. It was there waiting for him. The doors opened and he kept talking to his adviser. "When my predecessors tried to lead in a way other than fear people had their own ideas. People did their own things. It caused chaos. Fear means compliance. Compliance means order. Order means stability. Stability means growth." As the elevator started moving upward, he continued "Fear is the most effective tool to keep the economy growing. Therefore, we use it. It is not because I want to. In fact, I hate being this person."

The Chancellor looked to his adviser with a depth in his eyes. "I do this for my people. I keep them from fighting amongst themselves because they fear and hate me instead. Why does nobody understand that this is benevolent leadership?" The doors opened in the penthouse. "I'm going to bed." Chancellor Fulton started to head toward his sleeping chamber.

"But it's ten-thirty in the morning."

"And I feel like sleeping."

## February 15, 2275 C.E., Early Morning

### Terra Firma

#### New York City - Impulse Tower

##### Floor 57 - Chancellors Bedroom

The chancellor slept calmly, the sun had not yet risen over New York. The city was sleeping. Chancellor Fulton demanded that no activity occur during certain hours, people complied, or died. These were these hours.

##### Floor 42 - Secure Storage Facility

The secure storage facility was locked. The chancellor didn't trust keeping some thing digitally. Certain things had to be hard copies only. Hard copies were harder to steal, hard copies were easier to destroy.  All the cabinets inside and the door leading to the hallway had red lights around them. This room had the second highest security in the building. There was a couple thefts recently from a lesser vault by a blonde haired woman in the Jet Setters. Here, in 2275, this vault was about to be broken into for the first time.

The lights around the door turned green. It opened slightly and a young woman stepped inside. The hair wasn't blonde, it was dark, a dark purple. In the low lighting of the shut down vault it looked black. It would be reported as black. She smiled deeply. She knew exactly where she was going. There was a particular cabinet that held the most secure documents. She typed in a code. The code was not hers. If anyone looked up the code it would register as a blonde haired woman that was currently working in the Jet Setters. They knew each other. They both wanted to make a name for themselves.

The lights around the cabinet turned green. She opened the drawer, but she was not here to steal something. She removed a set of documents and injected other documents. She then locked the cabinet, left the room, and locked the door behind her. This wouldn't be noticed for years, if ever.

Cassandra muttered under her breath, "Well Dad, if you do actually build and use these towers, at least they won't kill anyone. At worst, it'll be a fun show."
