# The Pact

## July 30, 2295

### Eblypso

#### Kurrim Cross City

##### Main Street

Allorien and Tim walked amongst Allorien's home of crystal and glass. Tim took in everything he could. "This place is amazing." There were all kinds of Crysix walking up and down the street. Many of them had different halo colors of all kinds. The whole rainbow was present, except blue. Tim was garnered a lot of attention.

A semi-loud rumbling grabbed Tim's attention and he looked down through the glass sidewalk as a crystalline train rumbled past below. "You can even see the subways!" The light flickered off the building into Tim's eye and he winced.

_It's not that special,_ Allorien responded.

_It's so amazing!_ Tim thought back.

_Oh, you're getting better at that!_

_I'm trying. It's so unnatural to communicate telepathically._

Walking down the street there were Crysix of all shapes and sizes with halos of different colors. A tall muscular red haloed member of the species walked past them the other direction in the street. The red halo Crysix stared at him for much too long as they walked by.

_What's red mean?_ Tim paused, getting fully distracted by the situation.

_Oh, they're the enforcers, they're equivalent to our police force. Their caste in society is 'Taurnalê'_ Allorien motioned for Tim to keep walking.

"Why are they staring so much?" Tim started walking again beside Allorien

_You're different. They always get curious when someone else of another species is here._

"Are you visited by other species often?"

_No._

As they walked down the street each time Tim walked past the corner of a building he winced from the pain light reflecting out of the crystalline channels. Light was a constant presence on Eblypso and in many cases shot directly out of buildings. _Oh shoot, sorry._ Allorien though and handed him a pair of polarized tinted glasses. _I forgot people who aren't Crysix can't handle the light here._

Tim accepted them and put them on, "Oh, that's so much better." He looked around again and reassessed his surroundings without being harmed by the quantity of light coming off of the crystalline buildings. _Why are there no other blue halos here?_

_We call them connectors the thing you call halos. They keep us connected to the world around us and each other. Think of them as the way we interface with the energies around us. It's the connector that kept me hidden from your species for so long. It also is how we determine our role in our society and other various things that keep us connected with our own people._

_You didn't answer my question. Why no other blue ones?_

_Oh sorry._ Allorien paused to hold a door open for Tim. Tim stepped into the largest building on the street. _It's because the blue ones, like mine, are for those destined to watch, mentor, and connect, with other species that we helped bring into the universe. Most of the people with blue halos do not spend much time on this world._

##### Building 12

There were plenty of Crysix people coming and going from the building. Allorien walked confidently to the front desk. Tim tried to mirror that aura, but didn't do as well. The front desk was staffed with two Crysix entities with red halos. As they walked up he motioned to Tim. The security officer nodded and handed Allorien a clear pulsing connector which Allorien balanced above Tim's head and spun it like a top. _Don't move your head too much._ It hovered above Tim's head and moved to stay in place despite Tim trying to look at it.

"Excuse me?"

_The less you move your head the less likely it is to fall off. Think of it like your visitor's pass._

Allorien started to walk off. Tim quickly gathered his thoughts and followed him, _Visitor's pass? This is all too crazy. Explain it for real._

_You're here to make your case for why humanity shouldn't die._

"Wait! What? We only met a couple years ago." Tim turned to Allorien with an incredulous scowl.

_It's been 10 years. And humanity is on trial._ Allorien looked back at Tim with compassion, empathy, and sadness. _You being here will make a much higher chance your species is saved._

_Saved from what?_

_Our Brutality._ A soft chime occurred and a door opened in front of them. Allorien motioned Tim into the circular crystalline tube. Tim stood there.

"Wait, what? Should I get in?"

_It's your only option._

Tim stepped in, _that doesn't make me feel comfortable._

_Good, you wouldn't be a good leader if you were comfortable with that._

Both of them stepped in together. Microseconds they were in the elevator the door closed and streaked upward. Tim was not ready but he did not lose his balance. "How is everything here so responsive."

_There's a particle in the universe that you called the axion when you were first researching it. There were many times that humanity came close to discovering it's true properties. We use it as a limitless renewable source of energy. It also reads, and therefore can react to, the emotions of sentient beings._ Almost as if timed, when Allorien finished his explanation the door opened in front of them.

They were injected directly into a large glass room with a judge, jury, and Fae at a table to the right. "This looks like a court room." _It is._ Responded the judge telepathically. _Please, take your seat._ The judge motioned to an empty table on the left side of the room with two chairs. _I see he doesn't speak like us._ The judge projected to everyone in the room as Allorien and Tim both sat at the table.

_I do. It's just not natural to me yet._ Everyone looked at Tim as he responded.

_So you know how to use the particles._ The judge responded. Tim looked over to Allorien, who spoke next. _I, formally, on behalf of the species of humanity, ask for a pact._ Tim looked at them with a bit of surprise.

_Your request is acknowledged._ The judge paused, _Allorien you will defend humanity in this trial. Fae you will represent the opposition to a pact._

They both said back _Yes._

The judge banged a gavel. _Let this pact making begin._

_What's going on?_ Tim thought directly to Allorien who directly responded _Like I said, You're saving humanity._

The judge continued. _Ten years ago we, in this courtroom, we reviewed the course of humanity. Our initial judgement was that humanity was failed as a species and would be wiped out. Allorien presented new evidence, after the fact, and we suspended the case for ten years. What progress has been made in that ten years?_

Allorien stepped out from behind the desk. _We have developed a strong relationship with people in humanity. While we still only have direct contact with one human he has the ability, as you've seen, to use the particle despite not fully understanding it._ Allorien motioned to Tim, _There are many others who can use the particle, but cannot control it enough to contact myself or Fae._

Fae stepped forward. _Exactly. Humanity is a race of billions of individuals. We have had contact with one single individual. This particular human is not a sign of humanity's growth it establishes an anomaly. We cannot possibly make policy based on an anomaly. I motion that we remove the suspension and continue with the elimination of humanity._

Tim gasped loudly and stepped forward yelling, "You cannot possibly be proposing the mass extinction of a species?! That's absolutely uncalled for. What kind of trial is this?"

The judge gaveled very loudly saying _Order. Order in the room._ The room got quiet there was a long pause and the judge turned to Allorien _One more outburst like that and I will summarily judge against you. Human, sit._

_Yes, your honor. Proceeding my case: Yes this human, his name is Tim, represents an anomaly. As you very well know Fae, it's an anomaly we've never seen before. Usually when we see a species that can use the particle they either do not seek to explain it or they distribute the knowledge broadly enough that the knowledge is known en mass._

Fae spoke up again. _But did Tim seek to explain the magical powers? No. How he even knows about the particle now is confusing._

Tim again spoke. _I did not know about the particle until minutes ago, and Fae is correct, I did not seek to explain the powers I had beyond their existence. Allorien shared the fact with me in the elevator coming up here._

Everyone looked at Allorien. And the judge spoke up while the twelve member jury took copious notes _In that case your preliminary brief leading into this you explicitly contradicted this fact._

_Humanity has had a negative effect on Allorien._ Fae jumped in. _They are all liars and seek to abuse each other._

Tim stood up and stepped forward again. _That is also not true. Neither the person defending humanity nor the person prosecuting humanity are effective in their arguments. I suggest they both be removed from the case. I will represent both the defense and the prosecution._

The judge glowered down from the raised bench. _Allorien you are relieved._ Allorien sat, with a slight smirk around his mouth and eyes, they knew what was coming next. The judge continued _How can you represent both sides? I can expect you to have a preference to defend humanity given the end result._

_While I would prefer that result. If you, in an unbiased way, choose to doom my species, and you have the power to do so, I will have to abide by that result. I vow to represent humanity as impartially as possible and with the truth as I see it._

_Fae you are relieved. I will accept the arguments of this human as unbiased._ The judge gaveled. Fae sat down, his aura of anger was clear.

The judge then proceeded with the trial _You have requested a formal pact with the Crysix. This means the Crysix will offer protection from the other species coming to contact you, and you will work as an entire species to assist us with our defense and elimination of our enemy._

"There's another species about to make contact with humanity?" Tim asked.

The judge stood and glared toward Allorien. _Humanity doesn't even know this much?! How can you expect them to agree to a pact, if we are the only species they know?_

Allorien stepped forward and Tim motioned him to stop focusing back on the judge. _My apologies your honor, that caught me off guard. I will sign a pact as you describe. Regardless of who else is coming to contact us, you implied their intentions are hostile. I officially request the protection._

The judge sat back down. _You are a very interesting case. Most other child species that have gotten this far have declined our offer and tried open their own diplomatic channels thinking they didn't have to rely on our protection._

_I hold no such confidence._ The jury took copious notes about Tim saying this.

The judge turned back to Allorien _I can see why you are intrigued, Allorien. This child race is blazing a path we have never seen before, full of exceptions._ Turning back to Tim. _The full terms of the pact are this. Clause One, we will protect and defend you until you can do so yourself. Clause Two, You will agree to provide your skills and abilities in our ongoing war. Clause Three, We will assist you in moving technology forward and in all regards of social improvement, but you must make our existence public knowledge and provide open exchange of technology and social progress. Clause Four, If you, or we, choose to break this pact in any way humanity will be eliminated_

Tim shifted slightly. Fae stepped into the conversation _Clause three will be impossible. Tim represents only one faction of humanity and currently a civil war is ongoing amongst two major factions._

The judge turned back to Allorien. _This is the rule that is not to be violated Allorien. Pacts can only happen with species that are unified in their efforts. I have no choice but to summarily rule--_

Tim spoke up again just before the gavel hit the crystalline desk, _Before you rule against many billion lifeforms in the universe I have a proposal._

The judge paused with the gavel millimeters above the desk, and placed the gavel sideways. _The court will hear the proposal._

Tim stepped into the middle of the room and spoke to the proposal. _My proposition involves only edits to Clause Three. I propose that you and my faction of humanity freely trade technology as described. When I unite humanity, which I intend to, we will then have five years to make your existence public. All other clauses remain the same, including clause four._

There was a long pause in the courtroom. Then the judge spoke. _I reject your proposal. I propose this in the effort of our race being unbiased arbiters of humanity's fate: Clause Three, Allorien will assist your faction. Fae will contact and assist the opposing faction. Once you are united humanity will have a five years to make our existence public. If this clause is broken or you do not unite within twenty years Clause four will be invoked automatically._

Tim smirked slightly and said, _I have evidence that contact beyond your rules have already happened with Allorien, reaching out to me, and Fae, reaching out to Cassandra Fulton._ Tim held forth a data disk. _With that said, that would represent that status quo, I officially accept this modification._

The judge spoke with a voice that was both mental and physical. The room shook slightly as they said, _Allorien and Fae, you are currently in a court of law. If you lie right now you will be immediately executed._ Tim was shocked. Everyone else in the court room seemed to not be surprised. The judge calmed his voice to ask the question. _Allorien, Fae, have you influenced humanity in ways that violate our laws?_

The both looked up at the judge and both at the same time said, _Yes, your honor._

The judge sat down and calmly _I will add a clause._ He paused briefly and wrote down as he thought _Clause One: we will protect and defend you until you can do so yourself. Clause Two: You will agree to provide your skills and abilities in our ongoing war. Clause Three: Allorien will assist your faction. Fae will assist the opposing faction. Once humanity is united you will have five years to make our existence public. Clause Four: If you, or we, choose to break this pact in any way, or if clause three is broken, humanity will be eliminated. Clause Five: For breaking the law both Allorien and Fae will be demoted and a new Taurnalê will be assigned to Humanity. They will be checking in on you on a regular basis and will be granted the ability to remove you at their will from your assignment. Your Findecáno will also be asked to provide constant reporting as to your progress._ The judge stopped writing and passed it down to a Crysix Clerk who stood up and brought it to Tim. _Timothy Li, as representative of humanity, do you agree to these terms to bind all of humanity?_

Tim read though the document and handed it back to the clerk. _I do._

The judge _The next step is that It will be validated by jury who speaks for the Royal Family._ Tim looked surprised. The judge noticed. _I see you don't know our social structure either... You are entering this pact without clearly without all the context and facts. Are you sure?_

_Yes. I have faith your honor._

_Faith? Interesting choice of words. This court is adjourned for jury deliberations._ A loud strike of the gavel echoed through the room as if sealing fate. Everyone, except Tim, knew the jury was a formality.
