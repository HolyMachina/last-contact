# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Last Contact is a static website and, by design, has significant limitations in what it can and cannot collect from viewers.

## Data We Collect

We do not collect *any* data from visitors unless you submit feedback though the link on the right.

When submitting a feedback issue we will collect (on GitHub) anything you provide into the issue record. That issue required is subject to [GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) and is outside the scope of this privacy policy. You can submit issues without providing any personal data, we strongly encourage you to submit as little information in the feedback from as possible.

When you use the feedback link it creates an issue in a private GitHub repository. Please do not submit any personal data though the feedback link unless you are okay with it being available in a private repository in GitHub.

## Cookie Policy

The website is hosted on Microsoft Azure which uses a single cookie called "AARAffinity." It is used to determine your session to make sure you are always getting data from the same server to improve performance and security as the website is hosted in many servers around the world.

The "AARAffinity" Cookie is deleted when your browsing session ends. The cookie is not used to track you across websites. It does not contain any personal data and cannot be used to identify you. It vastly improves performance of the site and is considered necessary for the site to function.

## Retention, Deletion, and Affiliates

We do not retain any data, therefore we cannot delete any data.

We have no affiliate programs with any companies, systems, or groups.

We do not use any kind of login or integrations with any companies or systems. We do not engage with advertisements. Therefore we do not collect any personal data related to login or social media, technology companies. We also do not use any kind of cross site tracking system or market research items.

## Your Rights to your personal Data

If you find that we have incorrectly collected personal information, please alert us immediately so that we can delete it and provide you confirmation of that deletion as it was not intended to be collected in the first place.

## Changes

If this policy is changed a banner will be placed at the top of the site for at least one (1) month.
