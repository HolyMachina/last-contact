# About Josie

## Bio

I'm an elder millennial trans girl just trying to work my though every day as myself with all the authenticity I can muster. I grew up in the Chicago Metro Area in the US and lived in the Pacific Northwest for a little bit before moving back home.

## What do I do?

Well, mostly work. I work in a tech sector product manager job in a large company Corpo America. My career was as a random IT Guy, then Server Technician, then technician manager, then program manager, and now product manager. Clearly I like managing things.

## How about for Fun?

I play video games. My favorites include too many to name but here are some: Final Fantasy Series, Legend of Zelda Series, Sim City, basically most RPGs or Simulations.

## Do you watch stuff?

I watch anime, movies, and various TV Series. I'm into Star Trek *and* Star Wars. Anyone who says one is better than the other is... well... short sighted. They both have their purposes. Some of my favorite anime shows are Angel Beats!, Orange, Azumanga Daioh, Nichijou, Evangelion, Gundam 00, basically anything that can rip my heart out or give me fits of laughter.

## Outdoors?

Sometimes I go touch grass through camping or random weird stuff like that.

## Important things I believe in

- Time is an illusion; lunchtime doubly so.
- Impatience for victory always leads to defeat.
- Always be your authentic self; it's the only person you can be successfully.
- Freedom of speech does not imply freedom from consequences of that speech.
- If you make a system that doesn't support the humans in it, the system doesn't deserve to be supported by the humans.
- Accessibility isn't a feature, it's a requirement.
