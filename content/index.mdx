Last Contact is an ongoing [hopepunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk) sci-fi web novel. It takes place mostly in the 23rd and 24th century C.E. I've been working on various versions of this story since about 2005. It's to the point now where I have to stop drafting, rewriting, and editing myself into oblivion and just put it somewhere. The core idea for the story was a "what if" thought I had in 1994.

Each section of the site and the themes of the acts are detailed below in [The Sections](#the-sections).

For a tutorial on how to read the story see in the next section [How to Read Last Contact](#how-to-read-last-contact).
