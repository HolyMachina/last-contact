Last Contact is an ongoing [hopepunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk) sci-fi web novel. It takes place mostly in the 23rd and 24th century C.E. I've been working on various versions of this story since about 2005. It's to the point now where I have to stop drafting, rewriting, and editing myself into oblivion and just put it somewhere. The core idea for the story was a "what if" thought I had in 1994.

Each section of the site and the themes of the acts are detailed below in [The Sections](#the-sections).

For a tutorial on how to read the story see in the next section [How to Read Last Contact](#how-to-read-last-contact).

    WARNING: Sometimes the chronological order bubbles are this color and occur in the *middle* of a chapter. It is is important that you follow the link when the occur otherwise you'll start reading out of order.

Start with [Act 03 - Civil War: Projection](./lastcontact/civilwar/projection#december-25-1984)

### Publication Order

Publication order sequences the chapters in the order they’re written. Which jumps around both chronologically and thematically. This order is good for people that are keeping up to date with releases each week. As you're reading follow the banners with the hand holding a pen.
