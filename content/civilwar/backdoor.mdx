# Backdoor

## January 20, 2025 CE

### Earth

#### Washington DC

##### USAID Administrative Headquarters, Operations Center

The room was brightly lit with people has rows of computer interfaces. This was the nerve centre of all of the United States government's aid and humanitarian programs. This data could be used to connect lists of marginalized individuals all over the world, making them extremely easy targets. The walls had computer screens showing live security footage in the building as well as a map identifying various USAID programs around the world and their impact. A group of masked people walked toward to operations center. These masked individuals had building access and were allowed into the building. They were the new staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency.

"Yellow buttons everyone." A woman near the back of the room at a singular console called. Each person at their desk reached under the desk and clicked a yellow button between a green button and a red button. These three buttons were one of the most closely guarded secrets of the United States Government. The President didn't know they existed, The Congress didn't know they existed, The Supreme Court didn't know they existed. In 2025, it was a legend passed though the low level employees of the US Federal Government. Built in the 1950s and 1960s, this system would provide the last protection, but nobody alive knew how it worked. The last person who knew the full details of its function died in 2017.

The group of masked people were allowed into the operations center. Their badges worked. No alarms occurred. Moments later masked men were standing behind computer operators. It was a hostile take over of the United States Government, except, they had the blessing of the elected leader. A paper was handed to the woman who had her own console. It contained instructions to provision master accounts in the system for each one of the people that were masked, as well as three other master external access accounts. "Are you sure this is approved?" A woman in her late forties asked the masked man standing behind him.

"Yes. The leadership was quite clear." the man spoke with a young voice.

"Respectfully, I refuse. It will open a huge backdoor into governmental systems. You cant do anything without us." staffers all around the room knew what this would do. They knew where this was headed. The lead administrator stood stood. And clicked a barber pole patterned button on her console. "Everyone in this room has now been forcibly logged out. If you do not gain access from one of us willingly there will be consequences." One by one around the room everyone else also rose in protest. She lead her the rightful operators out of the room. These operators were unified in their belief that if you worked together you could do anything, they knew their job was to protect the data in these systems. The best way to do that, was by leaving.

The masked men watched them leave. "Well that was easy. we didn't even need the guns." he sat down a looked a the clean user interface of the normal 2025s login screen. He pulled out a piece of paper and typed in the presidential override to log into the system. There was a long pause. "That's odd," the man said. The systems flickered and the normal user interface went away leaving a black screen with green text prompting for input

Hitting enter the console returned the same blank prompt responding. "okay, I guess we're in, accounts first." He started typing, trying to provision new accounts and received red text errors. "This should be working. What syntax is it expecting?" Every command prompted errors. Getting more and more frustrated the errors per minute went wildly out of control, an automated program was triggered which generated walls of red text. "what the fuck is going on?" a few minutes later all the screens in the operations center went black. Moments later large red text appeared that said "SELF PROTECTION MODE ACTIVATED." The buttons under the console changed from Yellow to Red.

In small blue text underneath it said "Learn history kids." A printer on the other side of the room starting printing. the paper got passed up to the person leading the group who read it aloud.

> This system and its data has been moved into self protection mode. The data has now been encrypted transferred to multiple undisclosed COBOL systems. You must obtain a decryption key from every existing entity using COBOL or a system derived from COBOL. If any systems currently using COBOL are unenrolled without proper commands all data in this encryption will be unrecoverable."

"COBOL. Holy Shit. We were making up the concept of the deep state... but it's real. Tell the President, We're going to really have to do Schedule F. We can't let them lock any other systems like this. We have to get all the bureaucrats out of the system. Now."

#### Washington DC

##### White House

"... build the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in AI. And this will include the construction of colossal data centers, very, very massive structures. I was in the real estate business. These buildings, these are big, beautiful buildings." Trump said as stood with three of only 20 people left in the world who knew what actually happened at USAID. Most of the people, from both sides, who were in the room at the time had already been eliminated. This moment was the announcement of a company that would be built to obtain the dataset of USAID and any other agency that chose to lock their data instead of provide it to the new government of the United States.

"Do you think we'll succeed?" A staffer on the other side of the room asked quietly as the President continued talking about the new company called Stargate LLC.

"It's our only hope." The curt response came from the staffer's supervisor. "The only way we're going to restore the world at this point is we can get all the data in it. If we're going to get access to this dataset we need to connect AI with every dataset in the world. That's the only way to unlock it. Stargate is the only way. We need that data if we're going to restore the correct principles of this world." The supervisor paused then felt uncomfortable with the silence between them and continued. "I hate how he names shit. We were going to do this AI thing anyway, it was going to be used to consume secrets and gain power over people. Now? It has a bigger purpose. It'll crack this dataset open."

Sai and Allorien stood the back of the room near the staffers. Allorien looked at Sai. *Is this my fault? Did the virus I sent break them further apart?*

Sai looked back as the President of the United States kept talking *No. This was bound to be. Did it come quicker because of you? Maybe. This cycle repeats over and over again.*

*What cycle?* Allorien was honestly confused.

*It's the cycle humanity is stuck in. If they get to close to our ideals, if they get to close to their true potential, it all collapses.*

*Why? How many times have you seen it happen?*

Sai hung her head. *Too many. Their potential can only be reached when they realize that every human has the same value, they are equal. Once they stop trying to beat each other into submission they can focus on becoming the best they can be.*

*So, why don't they?*

*Every time they try it means that someone with extra privilege or power has to lose that. Those people don't like to be "torn down" yet they're happy to tear down others. So those people force their way back into control and reset the system and the cycle. That's all that's happening now, the cycle is resetting.* Sai and Allorien gained sick of watching this press conference and walked though the wall into the yard of the White House. Sai turned back to Allorien, *It has never been called a war but this always simmers under the surface of humanity.If it were in our society, would be called a war.*

They both walked further across the large lawn thinking about the impacts of what's going on. Allorien asked, *why did you want me to come see this?*

Sai said, *Because this wall was my last gift to humanity. I worked with them to build it in 1968. We built in this trap. I knew, information would be power in this version of the cycle. Cutting off that information was important. That was my last interference.*
