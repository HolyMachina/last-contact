# Reignite

## August 8, 2175

### Eblypso

#### Kurrim Cross - Building 16

##### Species Continuance Court Room

*They'll be destroyed by their own arrogance!* Mablung Halueve yelled telepathically to everyone around. He was passionate that humanity showed no value and should be eliminated. His maroon halo shook slightly with his own tense feelings in the moment.

*Give them a chance,* Sai pleaded. She was in the witness box of a large courtroom. She was the expert witness. *This appeal is unfounded.*

The prosecutor stood before her, his larger frame glowered down upon her. *That is not for you to judge.*

Sai bristled slightly. *Even in my retirement I am considered the foremost expert on this species. That's why I'm here.*

*Granted. Next Question: Did you ever interfere directly in humanity's affairs without their direct request?* He turned around and smirked as she paused for a moment. She knew she was about to open herself to her own legal liability if she was honest. He knew that too. Halueve prodded her without compassion. *I remind you that you are under oath.*

*Yes, I did.* There was a large gasp in the room.

*I refer this oath violation to Mablung Nalaea in line with her role. I will continue. Why did you take such an action?*

*To protect the species we vowed to nurture and support.* Said said proudly.

He smirked as he knew he had her, *I will remind you that the oath you took upon taking your role as Mahtan contained no such words.*

*All the other Mahtan oaths do. Just because of the actions of Mahtan Nhamashal we can't nurture, support, and protect this particular species?* She made her case for breaking the law of her oath. *Why has one watcher's error lead to us changing our own rules effectively becoming so passive and uncaring to humanity?*

*And what were you protecting them from?*

*Their own arrogance.*

*If you hadn't, would they have killed themselves?*

*Possibly,* Sai thought aloud.

*Did you intervene because it was a high possibility?*

Sai shifted uncomfortably standing in the box, *Yes.*

*I declare facts acquired and submit this testimony to the upcoming humanity execution trial.*

The judge, who also had a maroon halo slammed the gavel on the desk and said *facts discovery adjourned. The Oath Violation discovered here will be litigated in a year. Sai please begin your preparations now.*

## One Year Later, April 8, 2176

### Eblypso

#### Kurrim Cross - Building 32

##### Oath Violations Court Room

Mablung Nalaea was a long haired female presenting Crysix that presided over a dark and serious courtroom. Her maroon halo pulsed slowly with her own calm breathing. She used it as a way to express her own calm compassion for those that came before her in some of their darkest moments. She began, *You are accused, by yourself, under oath, of violating your oath as a watcher of humanity.* The was an air of discomfort constantly present in this space. There were few people here, these trials were strictly classified.

*Yes, I under oath, acknowledge that I understand the accusation and I am familiar with the accusor.* Sai's mental voice rang out from the darkness. These are the strict minimums for charges to be valid in the society in which the Crysix lived.

*The next step of this trial is for the litigators to state their case.* Lights came up on a table where three people were seated at a single table. Sai, in black robes, with a blue halo, sat between two people with maroon halos

One of the litigators, an androgynous Crysix person made their case, *Mablung Ehlark for the prosecution on behalf of Mahtan Sai. The facts are clear. We have an admission of guilt from the accused while under oath.* They sat again.

A male presenting litigator stood, *Mablung Garrik, for the defense, on behalf of Mahtan Sai, the oath taken is inherently invalid due to bias against the child species in question and should be revised. Therefore Sai acted on her own best judgement in line with the best principles of our species, and that always takes precedent when an oath is invalid.* The second litigator sat. The small room was empty and quiet. Nobody was allowed to see the proceedings here.

The judge spoke next. *Sai, you bring this case both as the accused and the accuser. You have the option to immediately drop this case. If you choose that action no judgement would be rendered for or against you, the status quo will continue and your testimony in this specific regard will be ignored. If you proceed a judgement may be rendered against you up to removing your standing as a good member of society including demotion to the rank of Rathal.*

*I would, officially, like to press charges against myself. Please proceed with the case.*

*Yes ma'am. Mablung Ehlark?*

Mablung Ehlark stood and moved toward the middle of the room, the dim lighting followed them. *The accused said under oath the following.* A holographic image of Sai appeared in the middle of the room and replayed the interchange in the previous court. *I present this as evidence exhibit A. I call Mahtan Sai to the stand.*

Sai stood and proudly moved to stand in a box built for witnesses. Nalaea swore her in officially. *Your truthfulness oath as a member of the Crysix species applies with all possible strength and consequences in this space.*

*I am aware,* Sai spoke the words loudly and clearly. It was the customary response.

The prosecutor spoke next. *Did you give the testimony in the clip just seen?*

*Yes,* she answered.

*Was that false testimony.*

*No, it was not.*

The custom with situations like this where the entire case is a confession is to repeat the exact question that lead to the confession. *Did you ever interfere directly in humanity's affairs without their direct request?*

*Yes, I did,* Sai responded.

The litigator paused and turned to the judge solemnly. *Prosecution rests on behalf of Mahtan Sai.*

The judge took a deep breath, and her halo pulsed a couple times calmly as the asked for the next case, *Defense?*

The male litigator stood. Sai was still on the stand, waiting. She trusted him. He said he had a trick up his sleeve. Time to see if it was worth it.

*You willingly violated the oath you took. Normally that would result in your demotion to Rathal. It takes some pretty extreme mitigating circumstances to get away with what you've done. So, let's hear it. What possible mitigating factors would you have to violate your core oath to your role in our society?*

Sai took a long pause and took a couple deep breaths in and out, everyone was still. *The oath itself is not valid due to bias.*

He jumped on her rhetorically, *Really? That's it? Please tell me there's more.*

She continued, *With any other species we watch and parent some intervention is allowed, and even required, to make sure they grow along the right path. You would never as a parent seek to never influence your child's life. You have to intervene, it's critical to their growth. That's all the species are, they are our children. That is taught to each of us in grade school.*

*I see. Humanity are still our children and therefore, despite your oath, intervention is okay. You clearly have strong feelings about this matter.*

*I do.* Sai said proudly.

*That's very honorable.* He said. This was off script. Sai didn't expect him to say that, and therefore began to worry about what came next. *What exactly did you do to violate your oath?*

Sai paused, this question was not planned. *I took actions that prevented the two superpowers of the time from releasing weapons that, if escalated, would not only destroy their enemies but also destroy the world.*

*You did this how many times?*

*At least thirty times. I lost count.* The prosecuting litigator smiled. They knew they were winning this. Sai was wondering why the litigator who was supposed to be defending her was making a good case against her best interest. He picked at something that still sat with her *And, what did you witness the day you retired.*

*The release of those same weapons, in war.*

*Why did you allow it this time?*

*It wasn't my species anymore. By this time Mahtan Allorien had followed in my footsteps.*

*You weren't retired yet. You could have stopped that one too. Why step back in your last moments?*

Sai was silent. She shook a little while standing there. She thought to herself *Did I give up to soon? Should I have stayed? Maybe I shouldn't have left it to them.*

She was brought back into the moment by a new question from the litigator who was supposed to be defending her. *You are the foremost expert on humanity in our society now. You must be aware of the reason humanities oath is different. You are yes?*

*I am.*

*Can you please state that reason for the court.*

Sai sighed deeply, *The actions of Mahtan Nhamashal and his team of Mahtan interfered enough in humanity where they thought we were gods.*

*And what did the next set of Mahtan do?* The pace of the questions and responses got very quick.

*Under guidance of our species leadership we tried to develop their beliefs to a point where we were gods, but they were still in control.*

*And what did that do?*

*Make everything worse. Because humanity didn't uptake the new thinking in the way we expected. They ended up using that very belief system to harm each other in direct opposition of our goals.*

*And what did our species decide?*

*To fully step back from influencing humanity and enforce the new oath, letting them fend for themselves, and if they survive or die, that is up to them.*

There was a long pause, then he said it. *So there you have it. You were wrong. As your defender, I have no defense for what you've done. Humanity has no hope.* The litigator turned their back on Sai.

*No!* Sai's telepathic waves shook the room slightly she was so angry.

*What do I have wrong?* The litigator stopped in his tracks but didn't turn toward Sai.

*Humanity can still succeed. There is still hope.*

The litigator didn't engage beyond saying, *I didn't say there wasn't hope. I said we decided not to intervene anymore.*

*A child will not grow without their parent's guidance.* Sai said the line that is the first line of the instruction for any new Mahtan. Even after her many hundred years of life, she still remembered the line she was taught in her early thirties as she was choosing her career.

The litigator turned around. *And what hope do you see in this species that is doomed to their own arrogance?*

Sai now understood what her litigator had done. She was so worked up that what she was about to say held a tone of pure passion, which is intentionally stricken from the Crysix species. *They are the closest child species to our needs. Therefore, we should do all we can. No matter what it is. Our experiments over these vast millennia could be at a close soon if we just give them the support we would give to any of our other children.*

*This is your opinion, it's passion, it's invalid.* The litigator said.

*I have a executed an analysis that comes from my experience, my passion, and the hard constructive data available.*

*What data did you use?*

*I was able to, over the years since my retirement, obtain the following reports from other child races* Sai produces a crystal which she handed to the judge.

Garrik said, *we officially submit this evidence,* as Sai handed over the data crystal.

Sai continued, *I have analyzed each child race, ourselves and the Crygin using the human species developed Kardashev scale of galactic civilization measurement. I added some important factors of which humans are not aware. It showed that humanity is clearly our best hope to save the universe from it's imminent destruction. That report is also on that data crystal.*

*So,* Garrik questioned, *you did all this analysis and instead of escalating though normal means you took it upon yourself to violate your oath and make your own decisions.*

*No, I saw humans and their unique abilities, violated the oath, then I sought to understand why what I saw was different from what I was taught about them.* There was a long pause as everyone in the room realized that she just implicated something larger than herself. The teachings about humanity were wrong, and it was covered up, by someone or something larger than her.

Garrik, her defender, continued pressing into her guilt. *That sequence admits your guilt to the facts of the case.*

Sai sighed deeply, *Yes, and it's true, and I am under oath to speak the truth. So I have been.*

Mablung Nalaea knew what Mablung Garrik was doing. They worked together a lot. Nalaea is a sucker for these kind of over prosecution arguments. It was working again. *Thank you Sai. I will render judgement in two days time. She slammed the gavel into the table.*

She then leaned over to Sai and telepathically whispered *If this evidence holds true you will reignite a centuries old civil war in our species*.

Sai sighed deeply and responded, *That's what I'm afraid of. That's why I had to be sure. That's why I had to confess the way I did. It's in the system now. It's recorded. Too many people know to hide it.*

Nalaea knew, this moment would change the history of the universe. She was honored to be part of it.

## The Next Day, April 9, 2176

### Eblypso

#### Kurrim Cross - Building Zero

##### Imprisonment Center

Building Zero was not it's own building, it was a bunker under building one. There were very few people who knew it even existed. Even fewer knew that it contained the only people imprisoned in the Crysix race. Usually punishment meant demotion to the lowest caste of society and the freedom, or lack there of, that is entailed by being a constant physical pleasure laborer in society. Everyone needed them, nobody wanted them. Their opinions didn't matter, they were not taken seriously.

However, a very few special members of the species were too dangerous to be a part of society in any respect. Of the nearly 14 billion of Crysix in the universe, less than one hundred had ever been imprisoned. The most important thing is that prison prevented death, which in turn prevented the reincarnation of their spirit. These were the people that were doomed to live forever, and never contribute to the universe again.

*Why are you here?* The room was dark. Spotlights were on a large crysix with no halo sitting at a table in a small caged room. He asked the question from the table without being able to see beyond the bars, yet he knew he had a visitor.

Mablung Ehlark, the prosecutor in charge of Sai's case, stepped forward up to the bars their maroon halo was casting the only light that the imprisoned crysix could see beyond the bars. *Because we need your testimony,* Ehlark said.

*What's the case?*

*I can't tell you that.*

*You've kept me alive and imprisoned for twenty two hundred years just to testify in cases that I can know nothing about?*

*Yes.*

*Who's the accused? At least tell me who I'm testifying against.*

Ehlark sighed deeply, *Someone who has followed in your footsteps.*

*I won't do it.* The response was instant. He would not testify against, people who agree with him.

There was a long pause, Ehlark didn't want to give this bastard anything, *She has levied a counter case that could prove you right in the end.*

*Okay. Now I'm interested.*

*You know what you have to do to get out of the cage.*

*This cage has kept me alive and here for this moment.* The large crysix sighed deeply, *I guess I should thank this cage for my chance at redemption.*

*Yeah, do you want a change to redeem yourself? You know the oath you need to take.*

*I don't trust you. That oath isn't redemption, the case is.*

*I wouldn't trust me either if I were you,* Mahtan Ehlark said.

*It's my only chance?*

*It is,* Ehlark said.

The large crysix looked confidently forward and said the words that would set him free. *I renounce and abjure the tile Zeus, King of the Gods, and resume my role as a member of the Crysix Species vowing to walk though the remainder of my life honestly and authentically as Rathal Nhamashal.*
