## July 4, 2278 CE

### Venus - Nova

#### Venusian Parliament Building

The breeze rushed across Senator Pace's skin. It was decontaminated but still stung from the safe levels of acid. His 5'11" and very skinny frame shivered slightly as it stung. *I don't know how people live here all the time.* He stood on the steps of a large iron building. It was the stalwart center of the Venusian government. He was a big player from a tiny political game on Pluto. Here, he was tiny, he shivered as he walked inside from the Venusian atmosphere. The air inside was fully controlled and felt more like home. *I guess they do admit their atmosphere masterwork isn't perfect.*

The atrium was large and bright with artificial lighting he looked around and saw various heroes of Venusian culture standing before him including Gabriela Jasko the founder of Pluto's constitutional republic that made it a vassal of Venus. However, that was the only person from Pluto recognized here. The rest of his people's heroes had been fully forgotten in this atrium of heroes. The very parliament of which he was a member chose not to recognize the colonies in the same way they recognize Venus. As he looked around he saw two people standing on the balcony above him King Romulus and Jaedon Beyar. The three of them shared a brief glance, it was enough. *Okay, we're good to go*

He turned around and standing before him was the Prime Minister. He had been PM since he was elected decades ago but he never adopted the tile and retained the title from his other job. "Hello Senator Le'Rue." He smiled through his surprise.

"You know them?" Le'Rue gestured to the pair in the balcony.

"At least one of them, yeah." Deception was common in this building. It wasn't a lie but what he said wasn't the whole truth either.

"I hope I have your vote on the bill today."

"You already know you don't." Senator Pace was blunt and accusatory. "It abandons two children for your own political protection by locking out opposing thought. You sacrifice life for your own safety."

"Well, one can always hope." Le'Rue ignored the point.

"Hope for someone to change their underlying values and principles?" Sen. Pace asked.

"Happens all the time here." After a brief pause the head of the Venusian senate continued. "Shouldn't principles and values change with new facts?"

"Uh, no." Senator pace realized the plan was starting to work. "Your confusing values and principles with policy goals."

"Excuse me?" The most senior Senator Le'Rue glowered at junior Senator Pace from the vassal state of Pluto.

"Goals are shorter term and change and seek to work toward values using facts, policies, past experience, and action. Values are durable and can never be achieved, they are large and things you always strive toward. It's a common misconception for people with no, or unclear values. They have a tendency to think goals are values." Senator Pace walked away. He knew that he was going to make a political enemy today. He just didn't expect Le'Rue to be so easy to aggravate.

From the upper balcony King Romulus and Jaedon shared a smirk as Le'Rue bristled alone in the middle of the atrium. It was an uncharacteristic moment of vulnerability for the prime minister.

#### Senate Chambers

As Senator pace walked into the large senate chambers he knew he had left Le'Rue a little shaken. He focused on the large dias in front of him. It was along a wall with a series of display panels the emblems of different political units within Venus were prominent while all the emblems of whole vassal states were present but muted. There was no mention of the political factions within each colony. A semi-circle of desks were setup facing the dias. His desk was in the back but near the middle of the semi circle on the main aisle. As he took it people passed by as they entered. Senator Pace hated the small talk. He engaged anyway for anyone that directly engaged him as they passed.

About half an hour later Senator Le'Rue entered he always made sure he was the last one on the floor. He intentionally bypassed Senator Pace as he walked in but he shook hands and small talked his way down the center aisle. Senator Pace looked up to the balcony to see the King and Jaedon looking down from above. There were a couple bangs of the gavel as Senator Le'Rue reached the dias and called the senate into session. "Order! Order! I officially commence this session of the Senate of Venus." The murmuring began to die down. *It's time* Senator Pace thought. "We only have one item on the agenda today. Arranging for the release of Gwendolyn Romulus, Princess of Venus, from imprisonment by Terra Firma.

The king of Venus stood on the balcony looking down upon the representatives of his people. Small desks surrounded a podium and larger desks on one side of the room. The Semi-circle formation of senate chambers has served its purpose well during all human history. A voice was booming from the back of the floor. It was Senator Pace, "We know who they are, we should arrange for their release as well. I do not care what we must give them, the war will be over if we have all three of them. Get them here safely don't take risks."

From the podium in front of the Senate Chambers came the response: "Senator Pace, we don't have the ability. Think about what we must give up just to get our princess back. " Senator Le'Rue responded. He was a short round man of deep voice and frustrated tone. Senator Pace was interrupting his flow of leading the other Senators.

After the arrest of Samuel Knudsen hit the news, the Venusian government requested the release of three inmates from Terra Firma's super high security prison for political prisoners. Unexpectedly, the leader of the Terra Firma Government, Chancellor Fulton, responded with two options. Those choices displayed on the board behind Senator Le'Rue.

"Let us start the vote." Senator Le'Rue dictated. The room was large, but everyone could see the display. The entire wall behind the podium was a screen to project anything they needed at any given time. A panel flipped over on each senator's desk, including Le'Rue's. Each panel had three buttons one red, one blue and one green and the detail of the three options appeared on the walls behind the leader of the Venusian Senate.

The red choice on the left, it was always there, "NO DEAL." Details where underneath. Gwendolyn Romulus, Timothy Li, and Samuel Knudsen stay imprisoned by Terra Firma Government. Terra Firma state channels do not start broadcasting on our media. Venus will not surrender ownership of Mars to Terra Firma. Names started coming up on this choice with the planet they stand for most of which were Senators from the Martian Colony. Northern Mars thought any deal was a beginning of the end to their sovereignty.

The blue choice in the middle said, "Partial Deal" Terra Firma frees Gwen Romulus and they take her to her father. Timothy Li and Samuel Knudsen stay imprisoned by Terra Firma Government. Terra Firma state channels will begin to broadcast on our media on all Venusian colonies. As names started coming up they were mostly Senators from Venus.

The green choice on the right said, "Full Deal" Terra Firma releases Gwen Romulus and returns her to her father. Terra Firma releases Timothy Li and Samuel Knudsen into custody of the Venusian military, and we give them the choice to return home. Terra Firma state channels will begin on our all Venusian Media sources. Senator Pace's name was the only one that appeared.

After a couple of minutes, the voting was slowing down and the numbers were stabilizing. It was clear that the partial deal was winning. Le'Rue's name popped up there shortly after there were enough votes to seal the deal. The smirk on Le'Rue's face was one of contempt for anyone who could consider voting against him... He turned that smirk up to his king. The king shivered.

A few minutes later the vote was final. Le'Rue's gavel struck the table. He pronounced victory. "Thank you all. We will plan for the release of our princess."

Senator Pace glowered at Le'Rue from the back of the room, everything went to plan. Le'Rue was was starting to make mistakes. It was clear Venus was abandoning the colonies. If Terra Firma media started reaching them nobody knows what happens next.

Le'Rue stepped down from the podium and exited from one of the wing doors. His stride was extremely confident. Venus' strength was still strong enough to hold everyone together. It was a clear divide between the planets represented here. The colonies that had no representation were already upset. The king knew, this was the opening he could exploit.
