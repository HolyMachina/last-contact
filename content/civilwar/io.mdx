# Io

## December 19, 2286 CE

### Io, fifth moon of Jupiter

The fifth moon of Jupiter was a hellish place for people who didn't know how to survive the small satellite. Between the volcanoes and the constant threat of radiation poisoning special space suits had to be designed. These spacesuits automatically convert the radiation that would be poisonous to humans into energy that was then used to cool the human inside the suit. Before the invention of these suits, even a few days on Io would be a death sentence. The suits made the moon of Jupiter at least survivable.

However, Even after these suits were created there were a series of unexpected deaths. New safety rules had to be put in place. The gravity fluctuated so severely, that when Jupiter was below the horizon gravity increased until being twice normal Earth gravity at it's peak when the large planet is directly on the other side of the moon. When the red planet is cresting the horizon the gravity is about equivalent to Earth's Moon. As the largest planet of our solar system reaches Zenith above Io the gravity of Io actually inverts and people and objects will be pulled away from the planet's surface. It was a hazardous place to train people to take part in combat.

#### Gish Bar Patera

##### North Central Base

The base was incredibly insulated and built on top of an unstable section of ground, even if the ground blew out from under them the base would be able to tether itself to the ground again with pitons. It has had to multiple times.

He could hear everything but dare not open his eyes. There was a giant crash that made him turn around. Sam was not the kind of person to not look.

"Don't look!" General Oskar Abildgaard yelled.

Sam complied and turned around very quickly. "What is that giant thing?"

"Your space suit."

"Uh, I won't fit in it." Sam was legitimately confused it was probably, at a glance, double his height.

"Sure you will." Behind him he could hear the general struggling with metal hinges and locks as he did something with the giant suit. "Okay, you can turn around now."

Sam turned around to find a monstrosity of metal roughly shaped like a human with all sorts of metal packs, fans, and what looked like rocket engines and armor panels.

"Okay, climb in." General Abildgaard waved to a section of the suit. It didn't look fit for any kind of climbing. It looked like it would topple down upon Sam if he tried.

Sam walked over to inspect it closer and it appeared the armor plates of the front of the chest, head, and legs were swung open. Looking into the vast machine. There was a hollow in the middle of it where he would just barely fit. There would be no way to right himself. "How?"

"You have to climb in backwards. Put your foot here." The general pointed at a stirrup that was hanging off one of the armor plates that was swung open.

"You can't be serious."

"I am very serious. This suit will protect you from what's out there." He pointed to the door that lead out to the volcanic surface of Io, moon of Jupiter

"How is this thing going to help me continue learn sword fighting?" Sam asked sarcastically as he stepped into it.

"It doesn't."

"Then why am I here?" The structure closed around him and hissed sealing shut with him inside.

"To continue learning your sword fighting."

#### Bosphorus Regio

##### Volcanic Training Grounds

"All the better to train you for the harsh hazards of battle." General Abildgaard always said when people asked why we would train people in such a harsh place.

"You can't expect me to believe that. Really, why here?" Sam raised his swords toward the general. Sam was in an aggressive stance with a small Japanese style sword in each hand. Gwen stood next to him with a steel staff carved with ornate symbols, however she did not share his aggressive stance.

The general moved on him, immediately found a hole in his aggressive stance and toppled Sam to the ground. "This place has been shown to give people the breakthroughs they need to make an amazing difference. Even after eight months of training, you still have a lot to learn." Jupiter was just rising over the horizon, and Sam was able to jump to his feet in an arc that took advantage of the weakening gravity. As they continued their combat training the general landed strike after strike on Sam. Gwen stood by with a book reciting and memorizing. After about five hours the general paused and said "it's time to stop for the day." Sam had not landed a single good hit on the General.

Jupiter had risen to the 45 degree angle and Sam responded angrily. "No! I will not be taken advantage of all day then told it's time to stop without learning or at least landing one hit! This suit is impossible!"  The general rushed over and hit the book out of Gwen's hand. It stayed in place as if frozen in time. Everyone expected it to fall, yet it did not. The general restated his comments. "It is time to stop, gravity is about to cause problems for us."

Sam, overcome with anger refused. He lurched forward and struck at General Abildgaard. Easy to see how his anger was driving him he parried the attack with finesse and flung him up into the air. He hung in the air like a child's balloon that was just about to loose it's buoyancy. Sam clicked a button on his bulky suit and small thrusters fired out the back to drive him back toward the general. Powered by the same radiation that would kill them the thrusters were used for emergences and removed power from the cooling system. Sam began to sweat as he flew down at the general for another aggressive strike. He blocked Sam with little effort at all. "Sam, calm down. This is not the time. Understand your situation."

As if for dramatic effect magma beneath them was pulled upwards by the gravity. The volcanic dome they trained on exploded and all three of them were thrown into the air with rapidly cooling rocks. The blast of suit jets happened from all of them to try to bring them down to the ground. Gwen was the first to reach the ground among the volcanic dome. She was sweating and breathing heavily, her suit blinking red with an internal temperature warning. She looked up and Sam was floating away from her, his suit blinking red inside and there appeared to be no motion, because it did not have enough fuel to compensate. General Abildgaard moved toward Sam in an attempt to grab him, but a couple moments later, he also floated motionless in the sky.

Gwen's training kicked in. She sat on the ground, closed her eyes and concentrated. She began sweating heavily in the harsh volcanic environment around her. Stabbing her staff into the ground and opening her book she flipped to a page she had memorized and started reciting double checking as she went. The top of the staff began to glow with a blue opalescent light which then expanded slowly. There was a pop and a bubble of water appeared around the top of the staff, the ground around the staff was cracking and breaking as if any remnants of water were being sucked out of the ground. She continued chanting as the bubble grew larger. The sphere successfully encircled all three of them. Their suits stopped blinking and quickly cooled. The last thing Gwen remembered was seeing was the general tether her suit to Sam's.

She awoke on a very cold floor and shivered. When she sat up the general was standing against a wall looking at her. "You saved our lives. Thank you."

"I don't know how. I didn't think I had that much power."

Telepathically Allorien said to her *You had very strong emotions in the moment. Strong emotions lead to stronger magic.* He had been watching over them the whole time.
