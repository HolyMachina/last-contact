# Hatred

## May 13, 2285 CE

### Terra Firma Empire

#### New York City

##### Impulse Tower

###### Penthouse Office

The four, formerly two, story penthouse at the top of Impulse Tower has been the office and residences of the Chancellor of Terra Firma since the Empire was formed. It previously served for the Emperor of the American Empire. Before that it was the space of the President of the United Nations of the Americas. For a couple of years it was even the Office and Residence of the President of the United States replacing the White House. The primary office was the entire top floor and had windows in in all directions with an elevator in the center. The main desk of the chancellor was on one of the sides by the window. It was designed to promote fear as a person walking to the desk had to cross the large open area completely exposed.

There was a time when he never doubted himself. Sitting at his intricately carved onyx desk Chancellor Fulton regretted the deal he just made with Venus. Releasing the princess of his enemy might turn out to be his undoing. He saw it coming. It was clear in retrospect that Venus got the better part of the deal. Especially if they somehow got to the other two people of her generation that would be her partners. But, he had those two safely in prison. In return for the princess, he got broadcast rights for news agencies to Venusian planets and some well meaning advisors said they could start *convincing* people to their side. While he controlled Terra Firma's media, there's no guarantee it would work. But his advisors will make it work, or die trying.

However, Chancellor Fulton was a strong man, he never went back on his word, especially his threats. Walking up the stairs from the lower level a relaxed, but formally dressed man of Mexican heritage walked into the room. The Chancellor looked at him with with a rare deepness in his artificially black eyes.

"There are times when a calm thoughtfulness is more powerful than forced action." Master Vera'Cruz was Fulton's most trusted adviser. He spoke up trying to slowly influence the Chancellor to be more compassionate. He could see this was a moment he could inject some of that guidance. There was a warmth in his blue eyes. A warmth beyond that of an adviser.

Fulton's black eyes began to glare back into his, the cold darkness had returned. "Action to make something happen is always superior to waiting for something to happen to you." The leader shifted uncomfortably and stood up buttoning his suit coat as he stood. He moved toward the window clearly intent on his thoughts.

The chancellor stared out the floor to ceiling windows. His adviser walked quietly to stand next to him. They stared out the large window upon New York. Impulse Tower, at 725 5th Avenue, was the largest building in New York. Everything else that was taller or close to as tall around the planet was taken down to make Impulse Tower even that majestic. He had a three hundred and sixty degree view of his city. He was looking south-east down the Manhattan Island toward the former site of One World Trade Center. "This world used to be very different."

"Yes, sire, you have had a strong impact." He said calmly.

The elevator dinged and the door opened. A military four star general stood in the elevator and paused as he looked up because he could see that Chancellor Fulton had turned around and was holding a handgun up toward him removed from a holster under his suit jacket. The chancellor immediately recognized this man as the general in charge of security of this building and it's property. "Why are you interrupting me?" The Chancellor's advisor, stood unflinching in the moment.

"Uh, Sire, the Jet Setter who defected broke in last night. I just got alerted and thought you would want to know immediately."

Chancellor Fulton leaned forward and raised his gun a little higher. "And?"

"She escaped." A thin white beam flew just to the left of his head as Chancellor Fulton fired at him. The beam left no mark on the elevator.

"You mean *he* escaped. What else?" Chancellor Fulton knew that undermining the gender of this person would help make them upset, emotional, and therefore make mistakes. Why didn't the rest of his people understand that?

"Uhm, yeah, there was a theft." This time the thin white beam flew just to the right of his head.

"And.. what was stolen?"

"I don't know what they were but two data disks were taken one labeled Samantha Knudsen and one labeled Timothy Li."

There was another blast striking the general directly in the chest. There was no blood or gore. The general collapsed to the ground in the elevator. He was deceased in an instant with no visible wounds or trauma. The elevator doors closed and the single golden elevator started descending. Someone else would take care of the body. The Chancellor wouldn't be bothered with it the next time the elevator opened.

Chancellor Fulton turned to his advisor with a very serious face. "Promote his junior, I assume he's ready. Also, lock down the prison on Tethys. If those two escape we will have to expand the war to solve that problem." He shook the gun a little bit in his hand. It was well balanced and light. "This is excellent work. Tell Dr. Palnov that he has the go ahead to mass produce these. To start, we're giving one to every Jet Setter." His advisor nodded at him as he was handed the weapon and he holstered it.

Chancellor Fulton turned and looked out the window again. "Also You know that's not what I meant. I didn't mean my impact on the world. This world, this empire beyond the single world, used to be mine. In the palm of my hand, controlled by fear and hatred. Entire generations that came before me ran the same way. It's been effective since the early 21st century. Yet, somehow now my control is waning." The chancellor looked down upon the city of New York.

"Somehow the structure of our world is falling apart." He pointed south-east. "There used to stand a tower, a tower that stood for over two hundred years in the and was taken down in the summer of 2249. That building stood for a unity of our nation and it stood in the foot print of towers destroyed by people who believed we were standing for things against their religion and that we should all die." Fulton turned back toward the larger city and became clearly more passionate. "Previous people in my position decided that that symbol and many others were no longer required. This tower, the one we stand in should be the tallest in the world. That wonderful symbol and countless others all had to come down. Simply because it eroded the power of this seat to have anything taller than this building in our city, nation, world, and solar system."

"Sir?" Master Vera'Cruz understood but didn't like where his leader was going.

"They were idiots. I am no symbol. There is much more value in symbols beyond me. He turned back to his chair. "How am I supposed to lead an entire populous when the only thing they fear is me. It's time for them to fear things beyond me again. If my daughter is going to succeed me they're going to need other symbols to fear." He sat down in the black leather chair and sighed deeply.

Master Vera'Cruz walked around the front of the desk. "What do you propose to do my liege?"

The Chancellor nodded as if he had come to the decision. "Bring me the best architects on Terra Firma. Bring me at least one from each continent. I will correct the blunder of my predecessors. And I will blunder of my most recent *deal*."
